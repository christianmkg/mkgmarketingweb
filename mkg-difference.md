            <p>We wouldn't exist without our people.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Our people are our single biggest differentiator. They have on average 11 years of experience in their specialty - SEO, Paid Search, Paid Social, or Analytics. Because our people are so important to the success of our clients, they're happiness is our biggest priority and that extends to their families.</p>

            <p><blockquote><i>"No man is an island" <cite>Kerry Guard | COO</cite></i></blockquote></p>
          </div>
          <p>At MKG we don't have a deep heirarchy. Our teams, or circles, consist of people with different capabilities, not the same. This allows people to work together and learn from each other. It allows us to deliver work faster because when the client emails their circle, the person pulling the levers is the person responding, minimizing the game of telephone or "whisper down the lane".</p>
          <p>We function as a team. We win together. One person may have sparked the idea, but we all made it happen. Every deliverable gets at least two sets of eyes before it hits a clients inbox.</p>

            <p>Always go above and beyond whenever possible.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Our goal is to go above and beyond the expectations our clients have. We don’t simply want to complete a task, we want to surprise you (in a good way!) with the final product.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Because we always seek to go above and beyond for our clients, our results, especially with Google, allowed us to become a Google Premiere Partner, something only 5% of Google Adwords Agencies become. We get 24/7 support. Access to beta targeting and products. Benchmarking data.</p>
