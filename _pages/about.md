<h2>About Us</h2>
<p class="lead">We have a little saying around here at MKG Marketing Inc: You should feel like our only client. Helping your brand succeed is our #1 priority. Let us tell you a little more about how we operate.</p>

<h3>Vacation Policy</h3>
We require every team member take 1 month of vacation every year. Spend time with your family, go traveling or just recharge your batteries. Use it or lose it!

</div>
<div class="col-sm-3">
<h3>No RFP's</h3>
We don’t participate in RFP’s or lengthy pitch processes, as it’s disrespectful to take resources away from our paying customers in the pursuit of something new.

<h3>Best of Breed</h3>
We are NOT a full service marketing agency. Instead, we focus on hiring specialized talent to deliver on a select number of services. We are snipers; masters of our craft.

<div class="col-sm-3">
<h3>Our Strength</h3>
While we work with clients both large and small, we keep our headcount low to focus on hiring the best talent and delivering superior service to our clients.
