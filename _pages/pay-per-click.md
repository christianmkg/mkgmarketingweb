<h1>Pay-Per-Click Case Studies</h1>
Since the day we opened our doors at MKG, we've experimented with nearly every type of paid advertising strategy you can run.

Over the last four years, we found that pay per click (PPC) was the sweet spot, so we developed our <a href="/process/advertising-manifesto">Advertising Manifesto</a> to reflect the way we want to manage PPC campaigns for our clients.

Speaking of those campaigns, take a look at a case study or two below.

<h2>Parallels Access</h2>
<div>Problem: How do we get people to download Parallels' newest, coolest remote desktop application?</div>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-7">
<h6>Our Solution</h6>
Fish where the fish are; Parallels Access application made it easier to collaborate on work files natively from their iPad. With that key insight in mind, we ran a Facebook app install campaign to build on the collaboration features.
<h6>Results</h6>
Generated installs at less than a $1, which was five times better than the second-best acquisition channel.
