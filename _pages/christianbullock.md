<a href="javascript:$('#biography').toggleClass('expandable')">Biography</a>
<div class="expandable" id="biography">Christian graduated from Washington State University in 2006 with a Bachelors degree in Communications with an emphasis in Advertising.
Shortly thereafter, he started his professional career at a small search marketing agency in Portland, Oregon where he had to wear many different hats and, consequently, learned about every facet of online marketing. His fortes in search marketing include organic search engine optimization and pay-per-click (PPC) management.
Christian enjoys playing ice hockey, a sport he picked up recently, and having tea parties with his daughters Marleigh and Penelope.</div>
