<h1>Conversion Rate Optimization</h1>
Conversion rate optimization is not just about changing a button color and launching an A/B test; in fact, we refer to that practice as A/B guessing -- not A/B testing.

Instead, our proprietary Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) process involves gathering and analyzing qualitative, as well as quantitative, data, writing up a series of hypotheses and designing conversion rate test scenarios targeted at improving the conversion rate of your website.

How has our process performed before? Check out a few of our case studies below.

<h6>Our Solution</h6>
A/B test two very different landing pages. One with a video, form and three benefits of the product. The second landing page was completely stripped down to a product video and sign up form.
<h6>Results</h6>
At a 22% conversion rate, our second test page outperformed the original by 69%.
