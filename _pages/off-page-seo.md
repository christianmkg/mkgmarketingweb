<h1>Off-Page SEO</h1>
When most marketers think of search engine optimization (SEO), the term most often refers to on-page SEO.

But that's only half the battle!

High-quality links pointing to your website act like freeway interchanges; they connect prospective customers from one place on the web to your site. As <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/lori_wizdo/12-10-04-buyer_behavior_helps_b2b_marketers_guide_the_buyers_journey" target="_blank">Forrester</a> research has found, more than two-thirds of your prospects have performed extensive research before they're ready to buy - don't you want your brand name to pop up in the process of their research?

Here's one case study for example.
