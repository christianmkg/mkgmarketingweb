A proud Washington State University alum (Go Cougs!) and West Coast transplant from Minneapolis, Mike has lived on three continents in the past twenty years of his life.

Professionally, Mike made his bones optimizing paid search campaigns & running social analytics reports for full-service advertising agencies in Los Angeles and Seattle before knocking heads with Kerry to open the doors at MKG.

He now spends the majority of his day developing client relationships and managing MKG’s growing web analytics and UX research practice.

Fun fact: Mike dislikes gummy bears.
