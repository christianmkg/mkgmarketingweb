Kerry is an East Coast native currently living in Redmond, WA after having met her husband in Hawaii.

Kerry comes from an eclectic background from assisting fashion photographers and apparel stylists in Philadelphia to interning for the in-house stylist at DKNY to landing her first real grown up job on Madison Avenue working for the biggest advertising agency in the country.

After working at three other major agencies (Publicis Modem, MEC & Wong Doody) on brands such as Verizon Wireless, General Mills, Microsoft, Western Digital, etc., she partnered up with Mike Krass on this new venture in an effort to pave her own digital marketing destiny.

Fun fact: Kerry is mother to twins! A boy and a girl. They know how to keep her on her toes.
