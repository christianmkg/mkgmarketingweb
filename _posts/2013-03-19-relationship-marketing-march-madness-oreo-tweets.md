<span style="color: #808080;">It was a <em>completely </em>spontaneous marketing move that tapped into an event unfolding in real time.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Known as <strong>real-time marketing</strong>,</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> these are tactics executed "on-the-fly" to determine an the best approach to a reach a customer at a specific time or place.</span></span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Combined with a<strong> relationship marketing program </strong>that focuses on customer acquisition, retention &amp; satisfaction, real-time marketing efforts could prove to be a big part of America's next big sporting event: NCAA basketball's "March Madness" tournament.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">So how can your brand or digital marketing agency combine relationship marketing programs with real-time marketing?</span>
<ol>
	<li><span style="color: #808080;"><span style="line-height: 14px;"><em>Automation</em>: Brands and agencies need to create a framework of predetermined processes within their existing relationship marketing program. Examples of these processes include integrating marketing &amp; analytics toolsets and aligning physical workforce with these toolsets.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Marketing Channel Integration:</em> How are your marketing channels integrated together? To the point above about establishing predetermined processes, making sure that you have identified and integrated each marketing channel in advance is critical.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Measurement:</em> Create goals and measure, measure, measure! Use these goals to show measurable failure/success of your efforts.</span></li>
