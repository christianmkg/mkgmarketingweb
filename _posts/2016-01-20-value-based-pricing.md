<h1>What is value based pricing?</h1>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Levitt" target="_blank">Ted Levitt from Harvard</a> said it best:
<blockquote><em><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>"...nobody ever buys a three-quarter-inch drill; they buy the expectation of a three-quarter-inch hole"</b></span></em></blockquote>
<div>Traditionally <a href="/services/" target="_blank">marketing services and consulting contracts </a>were priced in hours; each hour represented a single unit of billable time.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Makes sense, right?</div>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not</span> according to Tim Williams!</h2>
Tim runs<a href="http://www.ignitiongroup.com/" target="_blank"> Ignition Group</a>, a consulting firm that consults with (ironically) ad and marketing agencies. And Tim says that selling <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140818014955-2042198-why-outcomes-are-worth-more-than-services" target="_blank"><em>outcomes </em>is far more accurate than selling <em>services</em></a>.

Outcomes take the form of ...
<ol>
	<li>Business outcomes</li>
	<li>Marketing specific</li>
	<li>Customer related</li>
	<li>Channel specific</li>
	<li>Internal victories or political moves</li>
</ol>
<h2>The MKG Team Tends to Agree With Tim</h2>
Regardless of the specific type of services we contract with our clients, no 2 projects ever begin and end exactly the same.
<blockquote><em>In other words, no two contracts are ever alike</em></blockquote>
<h2>So how do we price our contracts?</h2>
<div>The variables we consider from a value and outcomes standpoint include:</div>
&nbsp;
<div>
<ul>
	<li><i>Unique-ness</i> of the Scope of Work: Is this pretty straightforward <i>or </i>will it be highly custom based on what this client needs?</li>
	<li>Outcome Desired: What are we asking to do here - grow traffic/rankings nominally <i>or </i>affect bigger impact?</li>
	<li>Total resources required: This includes human resources (hours invested), internal stakeholder resources (client marketing + engineering teams), tools and other financial resources we're likely to expend on the project</li>
</ul>
