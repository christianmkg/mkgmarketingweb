<p>As I wrap up my last week here at MKG, it’s hard not to reflect on what the team and I have been able to accomplish in four months.  Here are some of my favorite highlights:</p>

<p><strong>Launching the VMware OnDemand Ambassador Program</strong></p>
<p>Working with 48 VMware experts on a weekly basis to promote the latest product offering from VMware.  Not only did we drive the social conversation, but we saw a significant increase in sign ups for the program as well.  Working with this awesome group of influencers even inspired me to write a blog post on <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/good-influencer-in-six-simple-steps/" title="How to Be a Good Influencer in Six Simple Steps" target="_blank">How to Be a Good Influencer in Six Simple Steps</a>.  This program has continued to evolve, right now MKG is facilitating a contest around OnDemand called #CloudWithoutTheWait.  <a href="http://vcloud.vmware.com/service-offering/virtual-private-cloud-ondemand/cloud-without-the-wait">Check it out and enter to win!</a>
</p>

<p><strong>Boosting Dr. Samir Undavia’s Ranking</strong></p>
<p>Working with Dr. Samir Undavia to create nine videos for <a href="http://www.realself.com/find/New-Jersey/Princeton/Facial-Plastic-Surgeon/Samir-Undavia">RealSelf.</a> Getting his profile elevated to “Top Doc” and having him rank first for almost every plastic surgery offering on Real Self.  In addition, we created social media channels for Dr. Undavia on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google+.</p>

<p><strong>Goboxi Social Media and Beta Testing</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://goboxi.com/">Goboxi</a> was the first client I got to work with while at MKG.  They are a productivity app on mission to help people and companies save more time for what really matters in life.  I handled a bunch of social media channels: Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Pinterest to drive engagement and grow followers.  Not only that, but MKG led the charge leading beta testing for Goboxi.  We create an exhaustive list of early access sites, encouraged sign ups, recorded feedback and made key suggestions to improve the Goboxi website and product offering.</p>

<p><strong>Parallels Geek Out Anniversary</strong></p>
<p>It’s going to be a bit of a bummer not seeing the Parallels Geek Out Anniversary project recap.  During my time at MKG, I reached out to a bunch of influencers for this celebration and then handed the reigns off to Mike for follow up and <a href="http://blogs.parallels.com/consumertech/2015/1/27/celebrate-tech-anniversaries-and-win-prizes-with-the-parallels-geek-out-anniversary-celebration">launch.</a></p>

<p><strong>Direct Primary Care Connection</strong></p>
<p>While this project isn’t as public facing as our awesome clients might be.  I spent a lot of time working on it over the past four months.  From concepting user flow, incentives, sales projections to creating eBooks, blog posts and other sharable content.  I’m wicked excited to see this project launch for MKG in the (near) future!</p>

<p><strong>Friendships</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest take away from working with MKG has been gaining four new friendships.</p> 
<p><a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/kerry-guard/"><strong>Kerry – </strong></a>  It’s been a blast talking about Gilmore Girls, <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/referral/4498431">Stitch Fix</a> and weekend activities.</p>  
<p><a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/mike-krass/"><strong>Mike – </strong></a>  I love your comical side comments about completely random floating thoughts on HipChat and your historical insights on various clients and other individuals in your near vicinity.</p>
<p><a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/christian-bullock/"><strong>Christian – </strong></a>  Thanks for teaching me even more about search engine optimization and showing me what a good work life balance looks like via the Skype screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/adam-bullock/"><strong>Adam – </strong></a>  Your love for Winnie the Pooh, shall not be forgotten.  I’ll be forever grateful for your running “newbie” commentary.  Your insights on everything from clients to applications really did make me feel part of the team.</p>  <p>To both the Bash Brothers – GO BRUINS!  (Sorry, I had too!)</p>

<h3>What’s Next?</h3>
<p>So where am I heading to next?  That is a good question.  I’ve got a few things up my sleeve.  Hopefully planning another international trip soon.  (I joined MKG right after I got back from a 10-day trip through Cambodia).  Bullet and I are still going to be volunteering with <a href="http://bridgetowninc.org/">Bridgetown Inc.</a> at Night Strike.</p>
