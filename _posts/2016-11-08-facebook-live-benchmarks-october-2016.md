<h1>Introducing the Facebook Live Video product</h1>
We're sure that many of you have read about Facebook's new(ish) <a href="https://live.fb.com/">Live Video</a> product. In a nutshell, anybody with an iPhone can:
<ul>
 	<li>Log onto Facebook as a brand or personal page</li>
 	<li>Tap the 'go live' button on your phone</li>
 	<li>3, 2, 1 ... action!</li>
</ul>
Check out the photo below for visual reference.

<h2>Problem: What is considered 'good performance' from a Facebook Live Video program?</h2>
Last month, we partnered up with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Newbalance/videos/">New Balance to promote their Made Mondays live video series</a>.

Every Monday for four weeks, New Balance met with three different creators in New York or London to talk about their inspiration.
<blockquote>Why do you wake up in the morning and do what you do?</blockquote>
Because the Live Video product is so new for Facebook, they didn't have any performance benchmarks to share with us. We were curious about:
<ul>
 	<li>On average, how many users on Facebook tune into a live video feed?</li>
 	<li>How many of those users are your current fans?</li>
 	<li>What's the ratio of Facebook fans to live video tune in?</li>
</ul>
Facebook was unable to provide us with these benchmarks, so we went off the range and created our very own!
<h2>Behold: the October 2016 Facebook Live Benchmark Report!</h2>
To be clear, the data in this report was collected by hand. We actually watched all these Live Videos and tallied up the number of Live viewers, total fan counts and did the math to figure out how many fans engaged with a brand pages live video stream.

The objective for this inaugural report was to answer:
<ul>
 	<li>What percentage of a brand pages fans tune in to Facebook Live video streams</li>
 	<li>Which categories engage the highest percentage of their fans across four different categories (Media, Science, Technology and Retail)</li>
</ul>
<h3>October 2016 Benchmark for Percent of Fans that Tune in to Facebook Live Video: 0.2%</h3>
Analyzing eight different brand pages showed us that an average of 0.2% of fans tune into a Facebook Live video stream.

<h2>Facebook Live Insights from October 2016</h2>
While our process is *rough* (to say the least ;) and the data currently statistically insignificant, we were able to pull some additional best practices out of the eight brand pages that we monitored.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Go Live for 1 Hour+:</strong> It takes time for fans to begin watching your Facebook Live stream, see if they like it or not, and then share it with a friend. Case in point: the International Space Station was live for four hours (the absolute maximum amount of time Facebook will allow you to stream live) and only got in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uniladmag/videos/2430165973673114/">130,000 live viewer range toward the tail end of that stream</a>. Additionally, 0.6% of the ISS Facebook fans tuned in at some point of the four hour Facebook Live stream.</li>
 	<li><strong>Break the 'Fourth Wall': </strong>The most successful live streams included media brands asking the viewers to submit questions that they would answer *LIVE* on the spot. In addition to the Q&amp;A format over video, these brands were engaging fans in the post comment section by asking prodding questions as well as responding to their fans/viewers. These brands treated Facebook Live streams as an opportunity to speak directly to their fans - they didn't come in with an agenda past a few talking points and then turned the stream over to the viewers to see what they wanted to talk about. Great case in point? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laurenda.eddy/videos/10211686667461518/">Laurenda Eddy applied mermaid makeup</a> to her face (cannot even make this up...) for 17 minutes, taking tips from her viewers about different applications for the makeup. Nearly 1.5% of her fans tuned in to watch this, more than 86% better than the 0.2% benchmark we established in October.</li>
 	<li><strong>Be Wary of Self Serving Announcements: </strong>Building on the fourth wall comment above, Microsoft attempted to go live with their Surface Pro product launch. It completely FLOPPED compared to the benchmark we established across the eight brand pages, with less than 0.008% of their fans actually tuning in to the live announcement, despite the fact that they shared the stream to more than 46,100,000 fans on the Surface Pro, Windows and Microsoft Facebook brand pages.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Our open sourced plan: Contribute to this benchmark!</h2>
In the long run, our team can only watch so many Facebook Live streams. This benchmarking process is <em>not </em>scalable.

With that in mind, we'd like to open the floor to you, our readers. Fill in the form below anytime you see a Facebook Live stream and we'll include your report in the upcoming months benchmarks.

Any other tips or suggestions for compiling this benchmark in a more scalable way? Let us know in the comment sections below :)
