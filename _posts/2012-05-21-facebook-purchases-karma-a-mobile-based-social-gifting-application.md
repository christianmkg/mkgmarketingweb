<h2 style="text-align: left;"><em>With another agressive move into the mobile arena, Facebook acquired Karma for an undisclosed amount last Friday</em></h2>
Facebook has been making waves in the mobile space, with Karma being it's fifth mobile-specific acquisition this year alone.

The others include:
<ul>
	<li>Instagram</li>
	<li>Glancee</li>
	<li>Tagtile</li>
	<li>Lightbox</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>How will these purchases improve Facebook's product?</em></strong></h2>
Well ...
<ul>
	<li><strong>Loyalty &amp; Commerce Platforms: </strong>Along with Tagtile, incorporating Karma's loyalty and e-commerce capabilities could potentially open a new revenue stream for Facebook by monetizing all the social chatter &amp; user data into customized loyalty offerings</li>
	<li><strong>Visual upgrades: </strong>Instagram is a company born out of the ashes of amateur photographers taking professional quality photographs. The visual aspect of incorporating more still / video experiences into the Facebook platform will allow users to upload, share &amp; customize more personal content</li>
	<li><strong>Location Based Services: </strong>Glancee, a competitor of Highlight, Banjo, Circle (the list goes on -- <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/location-based-apps-at-sxswi" target="_blank">read more here</a>), offers location-based social networking services. If Facebook were able to combine this geographic capability with loyalty or commerce platforms like Tagtile / Karma, they could make a strong push into location specific loyalty &amp; commerce offerings</li>
</ul>
