<h3>More than 2 BILLION Google Searches Display Video Results Every Day: Is Your Brand Involved?</h3>
<p>Earlier this year, we began providing more value to our clients by <a title="Search Engine Optimization" href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/services/search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank">expanding our search engine optimization capabilities and experience.</a>Â A large portion of that expansion included writing long &amp; short form articles as well as producing infographics.</p>

<h3>But in our opinions, static content wasn't enough</h3>

<p>We not only wanted to expand into producing and marketing high-quality video content, <em>we HAD TO expand to deliver more value for our clients.</em></p>
<p>Even though video content is more time consuming and expensive to create, here are four reasons why your brand should invest in video SEO:</p>

<h4>1. 62% of Google searches include video</h3>

<p>ThisÂ represents more than<em> 2.2 billion searches every single day!</em></p>
<p>To put this into perspective, there are more Google searches that display video results than the entire population of China ... IN ONE SINGLE DAY.</p>
<p>Additionally, take a look at the image at the top of this post: Would you rather see a video about the best diving spots in Hawaii or read about it in plain-text form?</p>

<h4>2. Video is 50x more likely to get organic page ranks compared to plain-text results</h4>

<p>Forrester pulled together a list of the 40 most heavily searched keywords across Google.</p>
<p>This research found it's 50x more likely to land a video asset on the 1st page of a Google search compared to plain-text results. Additionally, an average of 1.5 video results appear on Google's 1st page, making up an average of 15% of all first page results.</p>

<h4>3. Video results have a 41% better CTR than plain-text results</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://www.reelseo.com/videos-ranking-universal-search-results-video-seo-study/" target="_blank">study performed by aimCLEAR</a> found that video results generated a 41% better CTR than plain-text results.</p>
<p>Digging deeper, their research found that the visual element of thumbnails present in the listing were a key factor that improved CTR.</p>

<h4>4. Articles that include video assets generate 3x more inbound links</h4>

<p><a href="http://moz.com/blog/what-makes-a-link-worthy-post-part-1" target="_blank">Casey Henry of Moz</a> found that video content is the perfect piece of content to create &amp; market because it fits the mold of both a) valuable, and b) sharable.</p>
<p>Given the choice, wouldn't you want each one of your articles to generate three times more inbound links?</p>

<h3>Keep in Mind: Quality over Quantity</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html" target="_blank">YouTube, more than 100 hours of video content is uploaded to YouTube <em>every minute.</em></a> That's a lot of clutter to get lost in, so make sure the video content you produce is both a) valuable, b) sharable, and c) optimized for your audience.</p>

<h3>What do you think: Is an investment in video content going to help or hurt your search engine optimization strategy?</h3>
