<h3>I’m Jenna Forstrom, the Link Builder, MKG has been looking for and I’m wicked excited to be joining the team!</h3>

<p>If the “wicked” didn’t already give it away, I’m originally from the East Coast, but have been living in Portland, Oregon since 2008.</p> 

<p>When I’m not staring at a computer screen I’m usually skiing at Hood or volunteering with Portland’s homeless community under the Burnside Bridge with my pit bull, Bullet. I love craft beer and checking out local breweries to watch any of the following teams: Patriots, Bruins, Celtics, Trailblazers, Timbers or Ducks.</p>

<h3>Skiing, volunteering, beer and sports get me excited, but so does creating amazing customer experiences.</h3>

<p>I get serious joy from helping clients get the most out of their online presence by recording, tracking and testing analytics. Helping clients serve up the best information, at the right time to their customers is the nerdy skill I’m happy to have and contribute to the MKG team.</p> 

<blockquote>As a naturally curious human being, I love testing and constantly improving websites and social media channels.</blockquote>

<p>As the newest member at MKG I hope to learn, teach and engage with our brilliant client base. Continue to help grow the business through eye-catching information and social media strategies. I also have aspirations of completing my Google AdWords certification during my time at MKG.</p>

<p>That, my friends, is a bite sized bit about me, Jenna. I’m looking forward to learning more about you and how MKG can help take your business to the next level.</p>

<p>Feel free to leave a comment letting me know what beer you drink while rooting on your favorite sports team. Just for the record, mine is currently Hopwork Urban Brewery’s Abominable Snowman while watching the Oregon Ducks.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Jenna</p>
