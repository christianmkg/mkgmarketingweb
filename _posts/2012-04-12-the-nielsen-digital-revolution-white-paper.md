<h2><em>We here at MKG Media Group wanted to pass along a great new white paper that was released by Nielsen last week.</em></h2>
<div></div>
<div>The paper, <em>The Digital Revolution:A Look Through the Marketer's Lens</em>, examines research data from April 2012 (as in <em>this very month!) </em>and uncovers some really great trends and data points for the digital industry.</div>
<ul>
	<li>In 2012, 274 million Americans have access to the internet</li>
<ul>
	<li>This is more than double the number of users in 2000</li>
</ul>
	<li>81 billion minutes spent on social networks &amp; blogs</li>
	<li>More than two-thirds of mobile phone time is spent on apps</li>
</ul>
