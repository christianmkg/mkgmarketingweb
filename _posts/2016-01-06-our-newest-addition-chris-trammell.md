<h1>I joined the MKG team at the start of the year as their Digital Marketing Strategist intern.</h1>
A bit about myself:
<ul>
	<li>Before joining MKG, I spent two years with BBVA Compass Bank. I worked in their customer analytics division.</li>
	<li>At BBVA, I helped build out the customer segmentation rules. We work with the retail banking division to develop reporting around product usage, cross-sell rates, retention, and other KPIs critical to marketing initiatives.</li>
	<li>Did I forget to mention? I have three years experience in data mining and marketing analytics :)</li>
</ul>
Working at BBVA helped to sharpen my data mining and analytics skill set.  This in my core focus here at MKG; supporting our the analytics efforts for SEO and SEM clients.
<h2>Okay ... let me tell you about myself outside of work</h2>
When I am not building out marketing campaigns, I like to run trails and brew my own beer.  I also follow the financial markets and enjoy listening to talking heads make predictions they know nothing about.  You can find me on LinkedIn and <a href="http://twitter.com/@T_rammell" target="_blank">Twitter</a>

Last but not least: I hold an MBA from the Berlin School of Economics and Law. Before living in Germany I earned an M.A. in Economics from the University of Alabama.
