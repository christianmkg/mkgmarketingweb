In a recent <a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/31829.asp" target="_blank">iMedia Connection article</a>, ROI DNA's VP of Branding Jim Nichols took a look at 9 different brands that used shock ads.

The brands included:
<ul>
	<li>Meth Project (photo above)</li>
	<li>Super PAC</li>
	<li>Dolce &amp; Gabbana</li>
	<li>Groupon</li>
	<li>Top Chef</li>
	<li>Sisley</li>
	<li>L'Oreal Dermablend</li>
	<li>Benetton</li>
	<li>Febreze</li>
</ul>
After grading each brands ad on a Win / Lose scale, Nichols made the following conclusions about how to create effective shock ads.
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Viscerally connect with and celebrate the lifestyle and values of the user</em></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sisley does that well, and stands out because its message is anathema to people who "don't get it."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Similarly, Benetton speaks to an emerging set of values most common among young tastemakers.</p>

<h2><em><strong>Depict more relatable situations and drama</strong></em></h2>
These are things that people can envision. The meth ads, like the example above, do this really well; we all know that the dire straits they depict actually happen.
<h2><em><strong>Direct emotional reactions to a clear set of action steps that tell us what we should do now that we are all fired up</strong></em></h2>
Febreze wins here.
<h2><em><strong>They go easy on complex analogies</strong></em></h2>
Very few people study ads, so their meaning needs to be immediately accessible. The Dermablend message shows an incredible demonstration with a strong impact. There's visual proof of the products effectiveness.
