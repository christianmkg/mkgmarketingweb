The other day, we walked you through the process of <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/measuring-mobile-marketing-conversions" target="_blank">measuring mobile marketing conversions</a>Â using an online conversion funnel.
<h2><em>Today, we'd like to show marketers how to identify holes, gaps and general inefficiencies in online conversion funnels.</em></h2>
<h4><em></em>Situation #1: Tons of leads begin the sign up process, yet few actually complete the entire lead generation form.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Possible Solution: Does your lead gen form ask for too much information or require sensitive information? Look at the sign up process from the eyes of your consumer and ask yourself "Would I actually answer these questions if I was a potential customer?"</li>
<ul>
	<li>Tip: Try going timing yourself as you go through the purchase / sign up process on your own product.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Situation #2: Inconsistent flow of users through each step of the sign up / purchase process.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Possible Solution: Say you get 95% of users through to step 2, 90% through to step 3 and then only 35% through to the fourth and final step. Take a look at the flow of questions between 3 and 4; What are you asking the user for? How could you acquire that information in a different way?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Situation #3: The form asks for too much sensitive information.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Possible Solution: Try using a service like <a href="http://demandbase.com" target="_blank">DemandBase</a>, which collects non-personally identifiable information (non PII, for short) such as industry, category / vertical, HHI, SIC code, etc and can populate those pieces of the form in the background without the consumer being asked.</li>
<ul>
	<li>Tip: A bit low fi, but have you re-considered internally whether you <em><strong>really need </strong></em>information that sensitive?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
