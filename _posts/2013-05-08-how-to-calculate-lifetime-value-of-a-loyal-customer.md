<h3><em>Do you know how to calculate the lifetime value of a loyal customer?</em></h3>

<p>Marketers often discuss the lifetime value of a loyal customer as a key metric to compare alongside customer acquisition costs, retention &amp; churn rate.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll walk through the process of <strong>calculating</strong> lifetime value using what's known as 'simple lifetime value' equation.</p>

<p>To begin with, I need to establish a few definitions:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Customer Lifetime Value:</strong> The total profit or loss seen from an individual customer over the 'life time' of their use of your product </span></li>
	<li><strong>Customer Acquisition Costs:</strong> Dollar amount your brand invests to acquire a single customer</li>
	<li>Customer Retention: The percent of customers retained against the number of customers that approached you for a cancellation of service</li>
	<li><strong>Churn Rate:</strong> The rate at which customers churn, or cancel use of your service, over a specific period of time</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that we have defined a few of the key terms to be discussed in this article, let's all step back for a moment and ask a question:</p>

<h3>How is your brand actually measuring the full lifetime value of your loyal customers?</h3>
<p>We examine three key factors to measure customer lifetime value:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Ability to measure across devices &amp; marketing tactic</span></li>
	<li>Understanding anonymous vs. known users</li>
	<li>Tools needed to tie these points together</li>
</ol>

<h4>Factor #1: Measuring Across Devices</h4>
<p>In this day and age, one of the biggest tasks involved in measuring lifetime value is:</p>
<p>Capturing and measuring lifetime value across devices is most commonly performed through <strong>aliases</strong></p>
<p>Let's walk you through an example of creating and integrating <strong>aliases</strong>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Your website provides an anonymous identifier, "user123" for example, each time a unique individual visits from a new device (iPhone, iPad, PC)</li>
	<li>When the anonymous user finally signs in, using an email form for example, they authenticate themselves</li>
	<li>As the user continues to sign in across devices (iPhone, iPad, PC) using their email address, that authentication process brings the disparate aliases together to create a complete picture of that individual user</li>
</ol>

<h4>Factor #2: Measuring Across Marketing Channels</h4>
<p>Building on Factor #1 (Measuring Across Devices), it's equally important to understand the lifetime value of the marketing channel that drove each user to originally purchase your product or service.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, let's discuss channel measurement in terms of last click attribution (as opposed to multichannel attribution).</p>

<p>Using aliases &amp; authentication, you can measure individual customer value down to the unique marketing channel that drove customer acquisition in the following format:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Customer Acquisition: How much investment did it take to acquire that customer originally?</li>
	<li>Retention Rate: Did she stay a customer following a free trial / initial sign up period? Or ...</li>
	<li>Churn Rate: Was she part of the percent of users who cancelled their service following sign up?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Factor #3: Tools Needed</h4>
<p>Your brand is ready to begin measuring customer lifetime value: Fantastic!</p>
<p>Let's outline a short list showing of the <em>type</em>of tools you'll need as well as a few examples of vendors that provide these capabilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Web Analytics:</strong> A web analytics tool will allow you to create goal conversions &amp; events to measure site engagement, marketing channel performance and product purchases. Examples of web analytics tool include <a href="http://google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="http://omniture.com" target="_blank">Omniture</a> &amp; <a href="http://webtrends.com" target="_blank">WebTrends</a></span></li>
	<li><strong>Data Management Platform:</strong> A data management platform provides you with the ability to create aliases, store anonymous customer data &amp; integrate known customer data points for users who have authenticated. A low-fi (yet powerful) example of an aliasing tool is <a href="http://kissmetrics.com" target="_blank">KISSmetrics</a>, while a more robust data management platform like <a href="http://xplusone.com" target="_blank">x+1 </a>would provide more customer data storage &amp; usage capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Sample Calculation of Customer Lifetime Value</h3>
<p>Now I'll caveat this calculation up front: There are a <em>number</em><em>of ways</em> to calculate customer lifetime value.</p>

<p>I'll just walk through what's known as 'Simple Lifetime Value' equation.</p>

<p>First up, let's get some definitions established:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(span) = Average number of years customers remain loyal to 'Client XYZ'. For this example, let's assume average span is <em>20 years</em></li>
	<li>(revenue) = Measured in months, this is the revenue the individual customer spends on your product. Let's assume your product costs <em>$20 per month</em></li>
	<li>(months) = measurement on an annual basis. Just as a reminder, there are <em>12 months</em> in a year</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's walk through a sample equation:</p>

<blockquote>(months x revenue) x span</blockquote>

<p>Now when we fill in some data pulled from the 'Client XYZ' archives:</p>
<blockquote>(12 x $20) x 20 = $4,800</blockquote>
<p>There you have it: Client XYZ's average lifetime customer value is $4,800.</p>

<h3>Your turn! Try plugging in your own company data into the model outlined above and see what comes out!</h3>
