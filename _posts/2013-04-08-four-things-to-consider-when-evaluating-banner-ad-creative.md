During a conference call earlier this week, the client brought up a great question:
<blockquote>How does your team evaluate banner ad creative? I mean, do you have certain guidelines to judge effectiveness prior to launching the banner advertising campaign?</blockquote>
The short answer: <strong>YES!</strong>

In fact, there are four considerations we take into account when evaluating banner ad creative:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Clear Value Proposition</span></li>
	<li>Clear Imagery</li>
	<li>Character Limit</li>
	<li>Actionable Call to Action (CTA)</li>
</ol>
To bring these considerations to life, let's examine a few banner campaigns we have run in the past.
<h2>Box 'Words' Customer Acquisition Campaign</h2>
In one of the first case studies we developed following the creation of MKG Media Group, we worked with <a href="http://box.com" target="_blank">Box</a> to create &amp; execute a customer acquisition advertising campaign.

Looking at a sample of the banner ad creative used below, let's walk you through our evaluation process.

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Box-words-2011-advertising-campaign-banner.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2431" alt="Box.com customer acquisition advertising campaign" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Box-words-2011-advertising-campaign-banner.png" width="330" height="275" /></a>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Value Proposition:</em> Easy and quick! €œSimple, Secure Sharing From Anywhere€</span></li>
	<li><em>Clear Imagery:</em> Cloud services product emphasized with white clouds &amp; brand name</li>
	<li><em>Character Limit:</em> Uncluttered design drives user direct to call to action</li>
	<li><em>Actionable CTA:</em>  Strong click here to begin a €˜Free Trial€™ call to action</li>
</ol>
So, how'd we do?

Well, the campaign <a title="Box" href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/portfolio/box/" target="_blank">improved their cost-per-customer-acquisition metric by 51% </a>and we won a<a title="MKG Media Group Wins an OMMA Award for Online Advertising Creativity" href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/mkg-media-group-wins-an-omma-award-for-online-advertising-creativity/" target="_blank"> 2012 OMMA award for advertising creativity</a>!

<h2>YouEye Customer Acquisition Campaign</h2>
When <a href="http://youeye.com" target="_blank">YouEye</a> approached our team to help bring their user testing SaaS product to market, we jumped at the opportunity.

Looking at a sample of the banner ad creative used below, let's walk you through our evaluation process.

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/YouEye-Banner-Ad-Creative-2012.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2436" alt="YouEye 2011 banner ad creative customer acquisition marketing campaign" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/YouEye-Banner-Ad-Creative-2012.png" width="323" height="270" /></a>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Value Proposition:</em> Three simple words: €˜Insights for Websites€™</span></li>
	<li><em>Clear Imagery:</em> Logo speaks directly to their value proposition. Green CTA button jumps off the page</li>
	<li><em>Character Limit:</em> Short sentence offers secondary CTA (€˜see for yourself€™) and then validation provided by Microsoft &amp; Zappos client roster</li>
	<li><em>Actionable CTA:</em>  €˜Try It Today€™ pushes users to not only click through but to test drive the SaaS product</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>So next time you are evaluating banner creative, make sure to ask yourself ...</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Is the value proposition stated in this ad clear? Do I immediately 'get it'?</li>
	<li>Does my imagery align with the text-based value proposition? Is there a clear connection established between the two?</li>
	<li>How many characters are in this ad? A good way to ensure the banner creative avoids clutter is to read through it: if it takes more than 2 - 3 seconds,  you've got too many words &amp; images!</li>
	<li>Lastly, is there a clear action that users are being instructed to take? Hint: 'Learn More' is not a clear action ...</li>
</ol>
