<h3>How Do You Properly Run a Marketing Test?</h3>
<p>We were chatting with a prospective client the other day when she made the following comment.</p>

<blockquote>I like this proposal. Let's run a test for the next six months to see how it performs.</blockquote>

<p>"That sounds great," I found myself saying "But, we want to align on whether this is a Strategic Marketing test or a Tactical Marketing test."</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In our opinion, the difference between the two is:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Tactical Marketing tests:</em> These tests pit one marketing line item against another in a survival of the fittest. Two may enter -- only one will leave!</li>
	<li><em>Strategic Marketing tests: </em>These tests focus on a testing a larger strategic direction -- investing stronger in brand marketing to widen your prospective customer funnel, for example -- than a battle royale test of two tactics.<em>Â </em></li>
</ul>
The client asked us how we approach determining the type of test. We mentioned using the following three guidelines:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> How will success be decided? Is there a single metric success is judged upon, or are there a series of metrics involved?</li>
	<li><strong>Test Length:</strong> What is the appropriate test length in order to declare a winner? Understanding statistical significance of the data produced will help answer this question.</li>
	<li><strong>Action on Findings:</strong> Does the client plan to make widespread changes based on test results? That's likely a strategic test. If findings determine a small portion of marketing efforts, that could likely be a smaller tactical test.</li>
</ul>
