<h3>Time flies when you're having fun!</h3>
<p>And that's why <u>when you watch commercials</u> it feels like <u>time is standing still</u>.</p>
<p>I'm sad my favorite TV shows are over for the season, but thrilled that I no longer have to watch commercials for the next three months!</p>

<h3>A commercial-free summer.</h3>

<p>Like four and a half million people, I, too, have hopped onto the Hulu Plus bandwagon. I have cut the cord and catch all my shows the day after they air using my iPad and Chromecast. It's awesome. It's TV on my time.</p>

<p>However, Hulu seriously has to work on their commercial variety. I have watched the Geico picture frames commercial at least 5 times an episode, once each commercial break.</p>

<p>Which got me thinking...</p>

<p><strong>How much time have I lost watching commercials on Hulu Plus?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I did the math. And it's eye-opening.</p>

<p>Check it out below and consider sharing with your friends and family - how much time are they wasting watching commercials on Hulu?</p>
