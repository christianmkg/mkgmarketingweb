<p class="post-intro">As we're approaching 2014, we wanted to take some time to reflect on how 2013 treated us. To be frank: 2013 was a kick-ass year for MKG Media Group. Allow us to explain why!</p>

	<h3>Our Clients</h3>
	
	<p>We couldn't be in the position that we are in now without our clients - both past and current. You trusted us to help grow your business, and we hope that our work rose to the occasion and delivered on your needs.</p>
	
	<p>Many thanks goes out to you for allowing us to be your online marketing partner.</p>
	
	<h3>Our People</h3>
	
	<p>2013 was the first year Christian Bullock, our Director of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), worked for MKG Media Group full time. Adding his skills to our team on a full-time basis supported a lot of the growth we experienced this year.</p>
	
	<p>We would also like to thank <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/author/jamin/" target="_blank">Jammin' Jamin</a>, who was our Summer intern this year and really took to his role with passion and gusto. He's now a Google Student Ambassador and we couldn't think of a better individual to fill in those shoes.</p>
	
	<h3>Our Focus on Giving Back to the Internet</h3>
	
	<p>Our entire team focused on producing timely, useful content for marketers to read and learn from.</p>
	
	<p>This focus on developing quality content paid off -- big time!</p>

	<p>As you can see in the Google Analytics screenshot, we made the following gains:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>6,303 more visits year-over-year</li>
		<li>5,000 unique visitorsÂ year-over-year</li>
		<li>7,843 pages viewedÂ year-over-year</li>

	<h3>So, What Does 2014 Hold in Store?</h3>
	
	<p>This next year holds quite a lot in store for the MKG Media Group team. Let us give you an idea of what we have planned:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Company Growth -- We're looking to add another talented digital marketer to the team in 2014. If you think you may be that individual, please email us at hello@mkgmediagroup and tell us why you believe you'd be a good fit for the team!</li>
		<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Revenue Growth -- In June, we set a Big Hairy Audacious Goal (<a href="http://moz.com/rand/vision-based-framework/" target="_blank">BHAG term courtesy of Moz founder Rand Fishkin</a>) looking to triple our quarterly revenue by June 2014. Why this number? Because it allows us to comfortably add another member to the team, invest in our company and host fun company-wide events like National Go to San Diego Day (oh yes -- it's happening!)</span></li>
		<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Our Company Purpose Revealed: We'll be announcing our purpose as a company; the real reason why we exist in this world and how we strive to make a difference. Stay tuned for that!</span></li>
		<li>Website Redesign -- With our company purpose exercise comes a ... SITE REDESIGN! Keep your eyes peeled for that as well.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>That's a Wrap on 2013!</h3>
	
	<p>With that in mind, we wish everyone a Happy New Year!</p>
