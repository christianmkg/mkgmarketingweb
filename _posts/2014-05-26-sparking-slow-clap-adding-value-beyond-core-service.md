<p>One of the most important question for companies is how to get customers to stick around. Since this is MKG Media Group and we’re in the business of <i>amplifying your awesomeness</i>, we go one step further: how do you get your customers to sing your praises? To chant your name while fist-pumping from the rooftops? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2-eRWgyGq8" target="_blank">To subconsciously hear an angelic chorus sing whenever they think of your company</a>?</p>

<p>How do you get your customers so pumped about your company they transform into brand evangelists?</p>

<p><strong>By adding value beyond your core service.</strong></p>

<p>Do this and you’ll spark the slow clap.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bigstockphoto.com/" target="_blank">BigStock</a> provides me value beyond just being my go-to spot for stock photography.</p>

<p>They describe themselves as a “fast, easy-to-use marketplace for quality stock images” and I would wholeheartedly agree! But why are they the company I remember and the company I recommend to colleagues?</p>

<p><strong>Bigstock offers a free image of the week (which is why there is an Australian ostrich at the top of this blog post).</strong></p>

<p<Granted, I can’t pick the exact image I want, nor do I have the option of downloading the previous week’s image, but it doesn’t matter! Free high-definition picture, woohoo! And when I go to their site, I usually end up searching for something random (don’t you when on a stock photography site?).</p>

<p><i>"Hmm, I wonder if they have any images of bulldogs in formal attire..."</i></p>

<a href="http://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-40678831/stock-photo-males-bulldog-with-two-females-all-dressed-in-formal-clothing-isolated-on-white-background"><img src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Bulldogs-Preview.jpg" alt="Bulldogs" width="450" height="251" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4645" /></a>

<p><i>Of course they do.</i></p>

<p>BigStock goes above and beyond being a great stock photography website. They provide me, their fist-pumping evanglist, extra value! And that's awesome!</p>

<h3>But Adam, I'm a plumber.</h3>

<p>How could you add value to your customers? How about a monthly newsletter with tips on proper maintenance of pipes? Or a guidebook on how to keep a home safe in the winter?</p>

<h3>But Adam, I’m an owner of a gyro foodcart.</h3>

<p>Offer your customers recipes or ideas of side dishes that go well with gyros. Even a stamp card provides value!</p>

<h3>Alright, mister know-it-all, I own a sports card shop.</h3>

<p>Educate your customers about the benefits of proper card storage, form a partnership with a local sports team for discounted tickets or hold promotional nights for particular sports, brands, the year of the card series, etc.</p>

<h3>But Adam, I do __________ (fill in the blank).</h3>

<p>By now, I know you get it. It doesn’t matter the industry, your product or your service: you have the ability to add value for your customer. And this added value transforms customers into evangelists who, like Conan below, may be prone to starting a slow clap in your honor.</p>
