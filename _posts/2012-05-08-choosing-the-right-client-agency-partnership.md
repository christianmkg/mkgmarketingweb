After reading this ClickZ article, <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2172153/choosing-partner-client-agency-relationship" target="_blank">Choosing the Right Partner: The Client-Agency Relationship</a>, we wanted to pass along a couple tips the author shared about building the right client / agency relationship.

Enjoy!
<h2><em>Tip #1: Make Sure the Agency's Skills Closely Align With Your Needs</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Situation: Many client-agency relationships fail because there is a mismatch between client needs and agency capabilities</li>
	<li>Solution: When brands are evaluating agencies' capabilities, they should keep the following items in mind:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Have a clear understanding of what you <strong>want </strong>and what you <strong>need</strong></li>
	<li>Don't let flashy presentation materials woo you -- make sure that the agency can deliver on their pitch</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2><em>Tip #2: Make Sure the Agency Has a Proven Track Record</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Situation: Oftentimes, agencies have a tough time delivering their pitched solution on time, under budget and at a high quality of work</li>
	<li>Solution: Verify the following things:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Track Record: What similar clients or programs have they executed before? How did they perform?</li>
	<li>Their Process: What makes their process special? Can they articulate why it works?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div>
<h2><em>Tip #3: Make Sure the Agency Can Play Well With Others</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Situation: Clients tend to tap numerous agencies to deliver on offline, digital and creative marketing needs</li>
	<li>Solution: Ask the following questions:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Experience: What other clients has this agency 'split duties' with across a set of marketing partners?</li>
	<li>Process: When working with other agencies, what processes are put in place?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
