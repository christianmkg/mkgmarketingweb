<h2><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-801" title="stream NCAA March Madness on iPhone" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/iphonebasketball-300x199.png" alt="Stream March Madness Android iPhone iPad" width="300" height="199" /></h2>
<h2><em>8.4 million viewers per game across 4 television networks &amp; more than 26 million site visitors over the first few days of the tournament.</em></h2>
Those are stats from the 2011 edition of the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, which means ...
<h3><em>The 2012 edition of March Madness is upon us.</em></h3>
To maximize the number of users who consume tournament-related content, fill out their bracket and stream live games on their mobile devices, the NCAA is <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/12/march-madness-app-android-iphone/" target="_blank">offering coverage on all iOS powered devices as well as across Android smartphones </a>(sorry, no Android tablets).
<h2><em>So what does this have to do with marketing and/or media?</em></h2>
Well, brands can learn something from the way the NCAA is executing their mobile strategy ...
<ol>
	<li><strong>Listen closely to your audience: </strong>Between the 2010 and 2011 NCAA basketball tournaments, the mobile audience viewing games and tournament content<a href="http://collegebasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/03/21/march-madness-tv-ratings-up-mmod-doing-even-better/" target="_blank"> jumped by 47%</a>. The NCAA's decision to expand mobileÂ compatibilityÂ to Android devices is a direct reflection of them <em>listening closely </em>to their viewers and providing a mobile viewing solution to the 30% of US smartphone owners running the Android operating system.</li>
	<li><strong>Communicate across channels: </strong>As we discussed in <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/understanding-how-media-channels-work-together" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, it's critical to speak to consumers across channels. The NCAA will ultimately reap the benefits of their expansion to the Android platform (additional advertising inventory &amp; pay-per-view streaming for games), but most importantly they will be able to establish an official presence as <em>THE </em>go-to place for March Madness coverage across mobile, broadcast TV and web.</li>
	<li><strong>New revenue streams: </strong>As IÂ mentionedÂ above, the NCAA will cash in on Android advertising revenue and streaming games live on an additional 104 million devices (<a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/2206/smartphones-cell-phones-blackberry-android-iphone" target="_blank">estimated Android user baseÂ according to Pew Research</a>) across the US. Are there similar revenue streams that your brand could tap into by adding new capabilities / functionality to your product or service?</li>
