On June 29, 2016, Facebook's VP of Product Management for the News Feed, Adam Mosseri, revealed that <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/building-a-better-news-feed-for-you/" target="_blank">Facebook is planning to update the news feed to include more personal posts</a> at the expense of posts from pages and businesses.

He wrote:
<blockquote>Today, weâ€™re announcing an update to News Feed that helps you see more posts from your friends and family.</blockquote>
And he links to ANOTHER update, published the same day, from Facebook Engineering Director Lars Backstrom with <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/news-feed-fyi-helping-make-sure-you-dont-miss-stories-from-friends/" target="_blank">the nitty gritty of the update</a>.

As an agency who delivers <a href="http://mkgmarketinginc.com/case-studies/pay-per-click/" target="_blank">outstanding PPC results for clients</a> (including via Facebook Ads), this news initially had us worried.

But I'm here to say:
<h2>This news feed update will have ZERO impact on businesses who are <strong>advertising</strong> on Facebook.</h2>

<i>How can Adam Bullock, <a href="http://mkgmarketinginc.com/about/team/" target="_blank">paid social extraordinaire on the MKG Marketing Inc. team</a>, make this bold claim?</i>

Easy, because Facebook:
<ol>
 	<li>Never mentions the words: "ad," "ads," "advertisement, "advertising," or "paid" in <strong>either</strong> of the updates.</li>
 	<li>Directly mentioned the tough "Pandora's Box"-esque difficulty that is showing up in the news feed (a common problem for any <strong>organic</strong> campaign on Facebook).</li>
 	<li>Knows how to make $$$ (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/27/technology/facebook-earnings/" target="_blank">Facebook made $1.6 billion in profit last year</a>, a <a href="https://investor.fb.com/financials/default.aspx" target="_blank">123% increase in profit YoY</a>).</li>
 	<li>Continues to increase the amount of money they make per user (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/27/technology/facebook-earnings/" target="_blank">from $9 per user in 2014 to $13 in 2015</a>).</li>
</ol>
No mention of less advertising spaces.

Zero mention of less ads displayed per user.

Only that traffic via "page posts" may suffer for companies with low engagement.
<h2>This update actually HELPS Facebook advertisers!</h2>

<strong>It's all about that detailed targeting, baby!</strong>

The more you share, like, and comment, the more Facebook knows about you. And this only INCREASES their capabilities to be able to include users in specific detailed targeting segments.

I was prompted to write this post because a Google search found NOTHING when I searched "June 29, 2016 Facebook news feed update" + "facebook ads." I hope, fellow marketer, that it puts your mind at ease.
