This spring, John Deer has added 'want' and 'own' buttons to a custom tab on their Facebook brand page.
<h2><em>This is an example of brands bringing Facebook engagement to the next level</em></h2>
When users  visit the John Deere <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JohnDeere" target="_blank">brand page, </a>they have the option to test drive the 'Deere Season' app, which allows users to fill in the blanks on a couple statements:
<ul>
	<li>"I ____ the John Deere 1 Series sub-compact utility tractor"</li>
	<li>"I ____ the John Deere H120 loader attachment"</li>
</ul>
The brand is also incorporating statements such as 'love' and 'crave' into the fill-in-the-blank forms.
<h2><em>How this engagement translates to sales</em></h2>
From a brand experience standpoint, John Deere marketing rep David Niederkorn said ...
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The campaign will "support John Deere dealers by inspiring new and existing customers to consider, explore, and perhaps purchase or upgrade existing equipment."</em></p>
From a CRM standpoint, Niederkorn cited the value in listening and responding to customer &amp; product feedback.
<h2><em>How does this compare to your brands' Facebook page experience?</em></h2>
