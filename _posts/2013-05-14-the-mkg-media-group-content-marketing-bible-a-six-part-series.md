As clients continued to ask for our assistance with their content marketing strategy, we thought it would valuable to create aÂ <strong>Content Marketing How-To GuideÂ </strong>here on the blog for our loyal readers to learn more about our approach to <strong>Content Marketing Strategy</strong> here at MKG Media Group

During the next six weeks, we will discuss the following subjects:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;">Creating a Content Marketing Strategy</span></li>
	<li>Description of Content Formats</li>
	<li>Using Data to Determine What Content to Write</li>
	<li>Using Data to Determine How Often to Publish Content</li>
	<li>How to Promote Your Content</li>
	<li>How to Measure the Success of Your Content Marketing Strategy</li>
</ul>
And if this couldn't get any better, at the conclusion of this series we will post the entire MKG Media Group Content Marketing Bible on our website as a free, downloadable e-book.
<h2>See you next week for Part 1: Creating a Content Marketing Strategy!</h2>
