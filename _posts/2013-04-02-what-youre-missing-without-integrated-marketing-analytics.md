<h2>Introduction to Integrated Marketing Analytics</h2>
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Microsoft, one of our larger clients, has several different marketing communications running simultaneously; they run paid online advertising, organic &amp; paid search marketing as well as social media and content marketing programs, just to name a few!</span>

But, as large of a company as Microsoft is, they used to lack a way to aggregate this data into one single analytics view.
<blockquote>Enter: Integrated Marketing Analytics</blockquote>
So when you hear this sentence out loud ...
<blockquote>We don't completely understand how our social media efforts affect our online advertising ...</blockquote>
... make sure to jump in and introduce the benefits of integrated analytics!
<h2>Current State of Marketing Analytics</h2>
How does your brand acquire paying customers &amp; how is that revenue action being measured and analyzed?

There is no shortage of measurement tools readily available to measure this€“€“but oftentimes they don't <em>integrate </em>well together.

Examples of tools include:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Measuring Paid Media: For paid media (online advertising), you can use web analytics platforms like WebTrends, Google Analytics or Omniture </span></li>
	<li>Measuring Owned Media: <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For measuring owned media (brand website), tools like Raven Tools or SEOmoz do a great job of measuring results</span></li>
	<li>Measuring Earned Media: For measuring<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> earned media (social), you can use a listening tool like Radian6, Alterian SM2 or PeopleBrowser</span></li>
</ul>
However, our clients have helped identify a weak point in using these tools:
<blockquote><strong>Everybody at our company is logging into their own tools &amp; measuring their own insular analytics!</strong></blockquote>
The social media director who looks at Radian6 will never dig in to WebTrends data because his job isn€™t to monitor site analytics; conversely, your site analytics person isn€™t keeping up with social media chatter surrounding your brand.

Each should care about the analytics of both avenues, because all the chatter they€™re working to promote is directed toward one central goal: REVENUE.
<h2>Benefits of Integrated Analytics</h2>
Marketing revenue is often generated from 3 main activities:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Paid Media</span></li>
	<li>Owned Media</li>
	<li>Earned Media</li>
</ol>
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">In our experience, marketing works harder for brands when the activities integrate &amp; learn from other instead of functioning separately€“€“a strategy that can only be measured with integrated analytics.</span>

By placing an 'umbrella' over the top of your measurement tools and pulling those sources into an integrated view, you experience:
<ul>
	<li>Cost Savings: Instead of wasting financial resources by paying humans to integrate data in an analog fashion, invest in a tool that aggregates multiple data sources together for your team</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Increased Efficiency: Stop wasting resources on aggregating disparate data sources and focus on what <em>action steps </em>could be performed to improve marketing performance</span></li>
	<li>"Single Window" View: Empower your employees, from the C-suite down, to view marketing performance in one easy-to-consume location</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
We've introduced you to the concept of integrated marketing analytics, reviewed the current state of measurement &amp; outlined the benefits received from investing in an integrated marketing analytics strategy.

<em>So how do you get started?</em>

Each brand is unique, but there are a few things to consider when investing in a solution like this:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">In-House or Outsource: Do you have the resources to build dashboards and, more importantly, analyze data &amp; perform quality control checks on a regular basis?</span></li>
	<li>Tools: What tools do you need to integrate? Also, what tool will you use to integrate them (homegrown option vs a pre-built framework, like <a href="http://gooddata.com" target="_blank">GoodData</a>)?</li>
	<li>Success: How will your integrated marketing analytics journey be measured as a whole? Will you measure the ROI of the investment? Improved marketing results?</li>
</ul>
