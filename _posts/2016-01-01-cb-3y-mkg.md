No, what you're reading isn't a name for a robot in Star Wars.

Nor does it have anything to relate to Y2K on this New Year's Day.

Today marks my - <strong>C</strong>hristian <strong>B</strong>ullock - <strong>3 y</strong>ear work anniversary at <strong>MKG</strong> Marketing Inc.

<strong>CB 3y MKG</strong>.
<h2>The Past</h2>
<em>To quickly reflect on the past</em>, I have to say: I work with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikekrass" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerryguard" target="_blank">best</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicareckerward" target="_blank">people</a> in the world.

Truly.

It's a great feeling to know that the people you work with you trust completely and that you genuinely like them as human beings.

Every Friday, the team gets together and talks about something they're grateful for. Since our offices are officially closed today, I'll make mine public:
<blockquote>I'm super grateful that I was sought out and was the first full-time hire three years ago.</blockquote>
<h2>The Future</h2>
So what does year four have in store? It's going to be crazy. Some of my plans:
<ul>
	<li>Sincerely believe that as years go on, we all need to expand our skill set. So I'm going to move more towards <a href="https://medium.com/@chrismessina/the-full-stack-employee-ed0db089f0a1#.jao2jq9wk" target="_blank">being a full stack employee</a> than ever before.</li>
	<li>Focus on technical SEO. With the Internet growing older, ensuring that a website's technical SEO is up to snuff is going to be a huge priority.</li>
	<li>Focus on action. Everything that I send to clients or colleagues will have a "what's next" type of action.</li>
	<li>Be less wordy. I tend to write long blog posts / emails / IM conversations. Shorten it up!</li>
</ul>
Enough about me: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what about you</span>? What are going to be your professional and / or personal focuses in 2016? Let me hear them in the comments, and then we can revisit January 1, 2017!
