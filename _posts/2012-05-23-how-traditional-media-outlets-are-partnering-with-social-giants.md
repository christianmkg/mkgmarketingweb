<h2><em>How can traditional and social media channels work together?</em></h2>
As media channels have evolved, marketers &amp; advertisers are constantly looking for ways to <a title="Understanding How Media Channels Work Together" href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/understanding-how-media-channels-work-together/" target="_blank">create the perfect communications mix.</a>

The answer to this question, oddly enough, is more often than not an additional series of questions.

Questions include:
<ul>
	<li>What value can each partner bring to the table?</li>
	<li>Does social deserve to partner with traditional media giants?</li>
</ul>
Let's take a look at a recent parntership between social and traditional broadcast TV outlets.
<h2><em><a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/2179362/sealed-facebook-tbs-deal" target="_blank">Facebook cut a deal with Turner Broadcasting SystemÂ </a></em></h2>
So, to answer the questions that were addressed above:
<ul>
	<li><strong>What value can each partner bring to the table?</strong></li>
<ul>
	<li>TBS gets to offer advertisers data-driven second-screen marketing opportunities</li>
	<li>Facebook essentially gets a chair at the 'grown-ups table', for lack of a better word, by joining forces with an established media powerhouse in Turner Broadcasting</li>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Does social deserve to partner with traditional media giants?</strong></li>
<ul>
	<li>Traditionally, social channels didn't have a seat at the big kids table because they couldn't generate revenue.</li>
	<li>With the Facebook IPO, social has their first champion that carries a 12-figure valuation, showing that they have the potential to generate a <em><strong>hundred billion dollars in revenueÂ </strong></em></li>
</ul>
</ul>
Think that this is a one-hit wonder deal?
<h2><em>Twitter just closed a <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/2174893/espn-twitter-program-links-social-tv" target="_blank">partnership with ESPN</a> last week</em></h2>
It's time for advertisers to place more emphasis on combining communications across media channels.
