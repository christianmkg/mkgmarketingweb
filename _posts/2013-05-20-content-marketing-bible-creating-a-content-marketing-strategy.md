<span style="font-size: 14.44444465637207px;">As we announced last week, our team<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/the-mkg-media-group-content-marketing-bible-a-six-part-series"> is producing a six-part series on content marketing</a> to be distributed for <em><strong>FREE</strong></em> via e-book at the end of June. <span style="color: #000000;">
</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 14.44444465637207px;">This series was born out of one simple question from a few of our clients:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 14.44444465637207px;"> "What steps does your team use to approach content marketing?"</span></blockquote>
Let's start at the beginning: <strong>How we create a content strategy.</strong> Enjoy!
<h2>Part One of Six: Creating a Content Marketing Strategy</h2>
This first part of our <a title="The MKG Media Group Content Marketing Bible: A Six Part Series" href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/the-mkg-media-group-content-marketing-bible-a-six-part-series/" target="_blank">six part series</a> will walk you through the following steps to create the strategy behind your content marketing efforts:
<ol>
	<li>Leading with a Goal Driven Strategy</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Outline Parameters</span></li>
	<li>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</li>
	<li>Using Data to Create a Master Keyword Playbook</li>
	<li>Creating a Content Calendar</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lead with a Goal Driven Strategy</h2>
First and foremost: All efforts should have tangible goals to measure success against.

To be more specific, these goals should focus exclusively on macro conversions, i.e. <strong>REVENUE.</strong>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As your group begins the strategic planning process, lead the entire strategy with these </span><em style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">goals in mind. </em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Every single idea your team brainstorms should focus on directly improving your bottom line performance. Great questions to consistently ask yourselves in the planning phase is:</span>
<ul>
	<li>What is the purpose of this content?</li>
	<li>What actions would we like our site visitors to take after viewing / as a result of viewing this content?</li>
</ul>
Some great examples of tangible goals to measure success against include:
<ol>
	<li>Increase in revenue from organic search engine referrals</li>
	<li>Measure conversion percentage in converting non-paying leads into paying customers from content, such as e-books, white papers or other valuable resources</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.2em;">Outline Parameters for Your Content Strategy</span></h2>
You're focused on <em>revenue -- </em>great start! Now, the process of outlining your content marketing strategy begins with assembling company stakeholders to have a candid conversation.

Here are a few great questions to kick things off:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Initially, how long will our content marketing effort last? A year-long test ... Maybe two?</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">What resources are we going to invest?</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Who leads this strategy? What success framework should be built up around that individual? </span></li>
	<li>How <strong><em>exactly </em></strong>will success be measured?</li>
</ul>
At the conclusion of outlining your content strategy parameters, your group should have the following questions answered:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;">Test timeframe for your content marketing strategy</span></li>
	<li>Resources to be invested; budgets, tools &amp; actual human labor</li>
	<li>Roles and responsibilities</li>
	<li>Estimated outcomes &amp; tangible goals of your content strategy</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14.44444465637207px;">Fantastic! Your team has outlined the parameters for your content marketing strategy.</span></h2>
<em>Next Up:</em> Who is responsible &amp; for what?
<h2>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
<span style="font-size: 14.44444465637207px;">We briefly touched on roles &amp; responsibilities above, but felt the need to drive home how important it is that your team understands who is performing what actions as well as who the responsible stakeholders are.</span>

A good way to break down roles &amp; responsibilities is outlined below:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;"><strong>Strategic Direction:</strong> This is a senior-level stakeholder who is going to drive the overall vision of the content marketing strategy</span></li>
	<li><strong>Mid-Level Managers:</strong> This stakeholder is part manager, part in-the-weeds with the assistants executing the content strategy</li>
	<li><strong>Assistant-Level Employees:</strong> These are the skilled individuals 'in the trenches' who are creating and promoting content</li>
</ul>
One of our favorite ways to visually display this is through a traditional org chart, like the drawing seen below:

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/content-marketing-strategy-organizational-chart.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2706" alt="org chart" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/content-marketing-strategy-organizational-chart.jpg" width="1296" height="968" /></a>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Using Data to Create a Master Keyword Playbook</h2>
At this point, it's time to determine what type of keywords your content will be created to rank for &amp; bring in revenue from.

In most cases, we pull this data from the following sources:
<ul>
	<li>Google Keyword Research Tool</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;">Paid Search Marketing Data (Google Analytics)</span></li>
	<li>Organic Search Marketing Data (Google Analytics)</li>
</ul>
Let's walk through each one of these data sources and then show you how to assemble the data.
<h3>Google Keyword Research Tool</h3>
Google Keyword Tool aggregates keyword performance data for each and every search performed on the Google search engine and presents it in a monthly snapshot. This tool hosts historic and current keyword data that can be used by marketers to use for research purposes.

Follow the steps below to use this tool for keyword research:

<strong>Step #1: Direct Browser to Google Keyword Tool</strong>

<strong></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Point your browser to the following URL <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordToo" target="_blank">https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool</a> </span>

<strong>Step #2: Authenticate</strong>

To authenticate, you'll need to do one of two things:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Be currently logged in to your Google AdWords account</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Enter a captcha (if you don't have an AdWords account)</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-size: 14.44444465637207px;"><strong>Step #3: Type in Beginning Phrases</strong>
</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">At this point, it's time to type in beginning thoughts on keywords or keyword phrases that your content will focus on.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For example: Examples relevant to this article include 'content marketing strategy', 'content strategy' &amp; 'content marketing', as you can see in the screenshot below.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14.44444465637207px;"><a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-keyword-tool-content-marketing.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2709" alt="google keyword tool screenshot" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-keyword-tool-content-marketing.png" width="1102" height="518" /></a></span>

Notice the labels 'competition' and 'local monthly searches'?

Competition indicates the amount of search competition those keywords have on a scale of 'high', 'medium' or 'low'.

Local monthly searches indicates the volume of searches each keyword recieves in the US each month.

<strong>Step 4: Expand on Beginner Phrases</strong>

Notice below the 'search terms' section of Google Keyword Tool is a section labeled 'keyword ideas'. See the screenshot below.

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-keyword-tool-keyword-ideas.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2710" alt="google keyword tool keyword ideas" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-keyword-tool-keyword-ideas.png" width="1081" height="302" /></a>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The 'keyword ideas' section includes similar keywords or keyword phrases that you may want to include.</span>

All these keywords can be expanded by clicking on the blue arrow to the right of the term and selecting 'show more like this', as seen in the screenshot below:

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-keyword-tool-show-more-like-this.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2711" alt="google keyword tool show more like this" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-keyword-tool-show-more-like-this.png" width="1081" height="169" /></a>

<strong>Step 5: Export Research</strong>

While Google Keyword Tool is a great start, your team is going to want to include more data from paid &amp; organic search sources to create a final version of your Master Keyword Playbook.

With that in mind, check the keyword searches &amp; ideas that you would like to export and hit the 'download' button.

See screenshot below:

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-keyword-tool-download.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2713" alt="google keyword tool download export data" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/google-keyword-tool-download.png" width="1096" height="307" /></a>

<span style="color: #443322; font-family: Asap, Verdada, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.2em;">Paid Search Marketing Data</span>

If your company is running paid search marketing campaigns through Bing Ads or Google AdWords, the keyword performance data can be a gold mine to include in your Master Keyword Playbook.

Let's walk through the process to pull this data from Google AdWords:

<strong>Step #1: Log Into Google AdWords or Google Analytics</strong>

In most cases, we connect Google AdWords and Analytics so paid search data flows directly into the clients Google Analytics account.

In this example, we would log in to Google Analytics to extract Paid Search Marketing data.

<strong>Step #2: Drill Down into Advertising Traffic</strong>

<strong></strong>Within the 'traffic sources' tab on the left-hand side of your Google analytics account, you'll notice a section labeled 'Advertising'. Expand this section along with the following section, labeled 'AdWords', to find Google AdWords Paid Search data.

After expanding those two sections, then click on 'keywords'.

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Google-analytics-Advertising-Keywords.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2718" alt="Google analytics AdWords Advertising Keywords" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Google-analytics-Advertising-Keywords.png" width="1479" height="696" /></a>

<strong>Step #3: Export Keyword Data</strong>

Similar to the Google Keyword Tool, you can &amp; should export this keyword data out of Google Analytics.

After selecting the correct date range, scroll to the top of the 'keywords' section and click on the 'export' button. We recommend exporting all data as a .csv

See an example in the screenshot below:
<h3><a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AdWords-Keywords-Google-Analytics-.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2720" alt="AdWords Keywords Google Analytics " src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AdWords-Keywords-Google-Analytics-.png" width="1347" height="683" /></a>Organic Search Marketing Data</h3>
In Google Analytics, the approach to find organic search marketing data is almost exactly the same as the approach we just walked through to find Paid Search Marketing data.

Just to be thorough, let's walk through how to pull organic search keywords from Google Analytics:

<strong>Step #1: Log Into Google Analytics</strong>

Navigate to your Google Analytics account and log in to your website profile.

<strong>Step #2: Look at Organic Search Traffic Sources</strong>

Navigate to 'traffic sources', then click 'search'. After the 'search' tab expand, click on the 'organic' section seen in the screenshot below.

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Google-Analytics-organic-search-traffic-sources.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2721" alt="Google Analytics organic search traffic sources" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Google-Analytics-organic-search-traffic-sources.png" width="1315" height="580" /></a>

<strong>Step #3: Export Keyword Data</strong>

<strong></strong>One thing to notice here is how Google Analytics will display keyword performance data by default (opposed to sources, landing pages &amp; more). These keywords are the data you want to export.

Just as we did with Paid Search Marketing data, you'll want to hit the 'export' button and select the file type as .csv, seen in the screenshot below.

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Google-Analytics-Export-Organic-Search-Keyword-Data.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2722" alt="Google Analytics Export Organic Search Keyword Data" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Google-Analytics-Export-Organic-Search-Keyword-Data.png" width="880" height="599" /></a>

<strong> </strong>
<h3>Assembling the Data into a Master Keyword Playbook</h3>
At this point, you'll need to assemble the keywords you've extracted from the three sources noted above and create a <strong>Master Keyword Playbook.</strong>

This playbook will determine what <em>keywords to target </em>when creating content and act as your north star -- all content creation decisions should be made using this playbook!

More importantly, these keywords should be what we call 'commerce keywords', or keywords / keyword phrases that drive toward a revenue-positive action. In our own Master Keyword Playbook, an example of using 'commerce keywords' is using the phrase 'how to find content marketing agency' as opposed to "content marketing tips".

In assembling your data, you are going to break down into two groups:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;"><strong>Broad Range Topics:</strong> Start with the 50,000 foot view, broad-range topics that you will create content around. Our own master keyword playbook includes broad range topics like 'Internet Marketing', 'Agency' &amp; 'B2B Marketing' as those are broad client verticals and services that we perform</span></li>
	<li><strong>Tight-Knit Keyword Groups:</strong> Within your broad topics, you need to create tight keyword groupings. Using the 'Agency' example above, our keyword groups contain keywords queries such as 'social media marketing agency' and 'social media marketing services'</li>
</ol>
The goal here is simple: Expand into as many broad range topics as possible, then tighten up your keyword groups within these topics.

This should all be performed within an excel spreadsheet. When your team has assembled the three data sources into a single spreadsheet, you'll end up with a document that contains 4 - 8 broad range topics and hundreds of tight keyword groupings like the one below:

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MKG-Media-Group-Master-Keyword-Playbook.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2725" alt="MKG Media Group Master Keyword Playbook" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MKG-Media-Group-Master-Keyword-Playbook.png" width="950" height="815" /></a>

&nbsp;

<em><strong> </strong></em>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.2em;">Creating a Content Calendar</span></h2>
You're so close to launching your content marketing strategy! At this point, we have established your content strategy parameters, tangible goals, stakeholders involved &amp; what you are going to write about.

It's now time to create a content calendar to outline the following:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13.993056297302246px;">Publishing Frequency</span></li>
	<li>Publishing Dates / Times</li>
	<li>Content Types to Publish</li>
</ol>
There are a number of great content calendar tools that will help your group collobrate across the entire organization. We've taken the time to list a few of our favorites below:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="http://contently.com" target="_blank">Contently</a></span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a></span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="http://www.divvyhq.com/" target="_blank">DivvyHQ</a></span></li>
</ul>
