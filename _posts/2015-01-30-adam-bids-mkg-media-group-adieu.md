<p>Well gang, this is it. I'm hanging up my MKG watch.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I have made the exciting (<em>and, admittedly, somewhat intimidating</em>) decision to actively pursue a career in education. From my time as a mentor and volunteering in a 2nd grade classroom, working with children in a learning environment has become a passion of mine and I decided to not wait another second and get after it!</p>

<p>I've had the honor of working with the incredibly passionate and talented team at MKG Media Group for nearly a year. I can undoubtedly say that you would not be able to find a more dedicated, detail-oriented and hard-working digital marketing agency as MKG Media Group.</p>

<p>It's a small group...but they're dynamic, resourceful and nimble.</p>

<p>And that small group includes my identical twin brother, Christian.</p>

<p>It's been an unforgettable experience working with Christian. I've been able to witness him in his element. He's one of the foremost experts on search engine optimization (<em>while remaining somewhat of a hidden gem</em>), and has been able to conjure some amazing tricks out of his hat for MKG clients. In fact, he's running a project called <a href="http://365daysofseo.com/" target="_blank">365 Days of SEO</a>, and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNVdI1wEdvv_jj3IUvT31qA" target="_blank">subscribe to his YouTube channel</a> for daily videos!</p>

<p>Being able to work together, we were able to have lunches together. And those lunches turned into running together. So, naturally, we decided to run a half-marathon! Going through the training and conquering the Columbia River Gorge Half-Marathon in October 2014 with him will be a memory I will always cherish.</p>

<p>I'm incredibly grateful to Mike and Kerry for believing in the Bash Brothers, and I'm proud of the results we all made together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/originaladman" target="_blank">Find me on Twitter</a>, where I'll likely be informing you of my own personal domain on the World Wide Web soon. I'll need SOMEWHERE to put my random marketing thoughts into the ether.</p>

<p>Bon voyage, MKG! I can't wait to see what you do next...</p>
