The American public showed <em>signs of shock</em> as the newest comScore search engine rankings for January 2013 <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/2/comScore_Releases_January_2013_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings" target="_blank">reported that Google owned 67% of the U.S. search engine market share</a>.

This is in conflict with what the typical U.S. computer user believes, which is 100% of searches happen on what the majority of them refer to as "the Google."

"Only 67%? There are other search engines...?" California-native Ted McKillicutty questioned, as he scratched his head.

While Google increased their search engine share by .3% from December 2012 to January 2013, it was Bing that increased to an all-time percentage high, boasting an increase of .2% to a total search engine share percentage of 16.5%.

"We are able to confirm that searches happened on other search engines than Google in January," a Google spokesman stated. "Obviously, this disappoints us greatly and we will work hard on promoting new and exciting doodles to feature on our homepage google.com to help promote synergy between the American public and Google."

Search activity in the U.S. was at 19.5 billion searches in January, which was 11% higher than December's total number. No doubt, a majority of these searches were for "Justin Bieber" and related search queries.
<h2>Let's Get Serious</h2>
Serious takeaway from these numbers? If you have a paid search program that only includes Google AdWords, <strong>you're missing on out showing your ad to users on the Bing &amp; Yahoo search engines </strong>(advertising powered by Bing Ads)<strong> which makes up 28% of the U.S. search engine marketing share</strong>.
