To put that into perspective ...
<h3><em>That represents aÂ minusculeÂ 1.5% of total political ad spending across all channels</em></h3>
TV, direct mail, telemarketing and other media channels account for more than 98% of the<strong> $9.8 billion </strong>that is estimated to be spent by the conclusion of this election cycle.

We'd like to open this question up to you -- our audience -- to answer the following ...
<h3><em>Why do you think online ads only account for a fraction of the budget compared to other media channels?</em></h3>
Look forward to your responses.
