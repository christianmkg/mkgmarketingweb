<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324" title="facebook ads for hubspot marketing" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-04-at-12.48.04-PM.png" alt="hubspot marketing cambridge" width="566" height="297" />

In a recent announcement,<a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/2181962/b2b-brand-facebook-ads-drove-sales" target="_blank"> B2B marketing software giant HubSpot</a>Â announced that running paid advertisements on Facebook generated a 71% increase in sales from social channels year over year.
<h2><em>This news is huge for Facebook following the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-22/why-gm-and-others-fail-with-facebook-ads" target="_blank">GM announcement that they would be eliminating their entire Facebook advertising budget</a></em></h2>
A couple other fun facts that Dan Slagen, HubSpot's head of paid lead generation efforts, disclosed were:
<ul>
	<li>Return on investment from Facebook ads was 15% better than their other paid channels during the first quarter of this year</li>
	<li>Site traffic to HubSpot.com from Facebook increased 39% year over year</li>
</ul>
Despite all the positive momentum that HubSpot saw from Facebook ads, Slagen was very cautious and realistic when he described their paid lead generation strategy ...
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><em>"It's a fallacy that paid leads are easy," he said. "It took time. We looked at planning. We looked at post-click issues. We looked at market seasonality and day-parting."</em></h2>
So now the all important question: What levers did HubSpot pull to deliver this performance?

Slagen cited ...
<ul>
	<li>'Like gating' offers on ebooks and product trials that were targeted at marketing directors &amp; decision makers based upon their recent 'like' activity</li>
	<li>Deployed sponsored stories to build on their existing momentum of users who had already 'liked' the HubSpot brand page</li>
	<li>Created a custom 'Try HubSpot for 30 days free!' tab on their Facebook page</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>What this all tells me is that ...</em></h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Treat Facebook Ads Like a Big Kid: </strong>This case study is living proof that Facebook ads deserve a share of marketers tactical time &amp; energy in planning an effective campaign. Simply 'turning on likes' doesn't actually move the needle -- like any of the traditional or established digital mediums, you need to commit to a diverse marketing mix within the Facebook platform in order to generate real results.</li>
	<li><strong>Facebook Can Generate Leads ... For the Right Brand: </strong>As other brands come forward with their pro &amp; anti-Facebook advertising stories, it will be interesting to see which types of brands (B2B vs. B2C, for example) will band together and see the best performance.</li>
<ul>
	<li>For example, General Motors pulled theirÂ automobileÂ advertising on Facebook.</li>
	<li>Could carsÂ technicallyÂ be 'un-sellable' on Facebook?</li>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Agencies Need to Be Smarter: </strong>When your client comes to you and wants to gain '100,000 likes' just for shits and giggles, agencies need to have theÂ wherewithalÂ to ask intelligent questions:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Why do you want 100,000 additional fans?</li>
	<li>What do you hope to achieve by bringing on these fans?</li>
	<li>Where does fan acquisition and hard business metrics collide for your brand in the social space?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
