<h1>MKG is hiring!</h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog post outlines an internship opportunity here at MKG Marketing Inc beginning in January 2016.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This job posting will cover:</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision &amp; opportunity: Who is this person and how far can they spread their wings?</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day to day: What your role and responsibility will look like.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job requirements: What skills should you already have?</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Vision &amp; Opportunity</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This position is an Internship-to-Full Time Employment (FTE) opportunity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfect world, we’d like to hire this job as an intern for the Spring and, if everybody enjoys working together, a full time job offer would be extended in June 2016.</span>

My main man Dwight from the Office couldn't say it any better.

<h2>Our vision for this position:</h2>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% Paid Social (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) Strategy &amp; Optimization</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25% Paid Search (AdWords and Bing Ads) Strategy &amp; Optimization</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for outside-of-the-box thinkers; individuals who aren’t afraid to think of new ways to try things and test. Ideally: you have your testing hat on 24/7 and are continuously thinking about how you can try new ad copy / imagery / targeting / etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know that failure is inevitable. But failing is learning. And you can react quickly to try something new if you see something not gaining traction like you thought it would.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be working with client accounts that allow the flexibility to test and try new things.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our opinion, the opportunity upside is huge for this position. We want to hire a motivated individual who can grow into this job.</span>
