Los Angeles Clippers superstar Blake Griffin's dunk on Kendrick Perkins was <strong><em>absolutely</em> <em>epic</em></strong> (if you haven't seen it, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbyOevVAYQI" target="_blank">click here)</a> and reminded me of a conversation I recently had with a client.

The client wanted to know ...
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><em>When should I have media and/or advertising in the market?</em></h2>
In essence, they wanted to know if they should be advertising like Blake Griffin dunks -- <strong><em>as in all the time</em></strong> -- or if there is a strategy commonly used to determine key messaging timeframes.

To help guide the conversation, I began the question with the following:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Peak Season: </strong>When is the peak sales season of your company / industry? How much historical data do you have to support this fact?</li>
	<li><strong>Off-Peak Season: </strong>Could you steal market share from competitors during your industries off-peak seasonal time frame? Again, do you have historical data to support your response?</li>
	<li><strong>Product Announcements: </strong>Notice that Verizon advertises launch dates of new Android 4G smartphones nearly a month in advance? They use the Hollywood 'Coming to a Theatre Near You on ...." to build buzz around their launches.</li>
	<li><strong>Company Announcements: </strong>Are you about to hire Steve Balmer away from Microsoft to run your company? A huge company announcement would be a great time to deliver your brand / product message.</li>
</ul>
Advertisers don't <em><strong>need </strong></em>to be advertising like Blake Griffin dunks year round. What they <strong><em>need</em></strong> to do is use the questions above to kickstart the conversation.
