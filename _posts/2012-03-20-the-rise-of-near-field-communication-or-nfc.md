NFC is the technology behind <a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/" target="_blank">Google Wallet</a>Â as a mobile payment processor, specifically ...
<h2><em>What is NFC?</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li>NFC technology is a short-range tool that operates on wireless frequencies. It works by connecting a user's mobile device, equipped with an NFC antenna or specially programmed SIM / SD data card, to a receiver to transfer money</li>
	<li>Using NFC requires no set up ahead of time; you simply touch or tap your smartphone to the receiver</li>
	<li>The user must be within a few feet of the receiver to create a NFC transaction</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>How is NFC being used?</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Right now, a lot of the activity around NFC is in the mobile payment space</li>
	<li>In the long run, NFC's capability to connect a consumer's mobile handset to the face-to-face experience of a store visit could be of value as brands look to integrate a more digital shopping experience into their customers lives</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>How can brands &amp; marketers tap into NFC?</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Marketers can use NFC to connect with consumers 'in real life', via their mobile devices</li>
<ul>
	<li>Imagine in-retail signage that prompts users to check their smartphone for a coupon, deal or offer that is redeemable immediately</li>
</ul>
	<li>Connecting user data from a 'mobile wallet', as Google dubs their NFC product, to create a custom- tailored shopping experience based upon Â past shopping activity, demographic and geographic data</li>
	<li>Based on this data, create more 'sticky', or loyal, customers that continually return to purchase good / services from your brand</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Keep in mind, not all smartphones are NFC enabled</em></h2>
It's important to understand the number of consumers that have the appropriate NFC antenna or SIM/SD card to actually create this experience for the consumer.
