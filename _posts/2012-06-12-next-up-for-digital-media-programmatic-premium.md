As a digital media agency, we areÂ constantly toeing the line between buying programmatic, hyper-effecient channels (DSP's, for example) and contextually relevant, brand-targeted environments (site direct).
<h2><em>Why do we toe this line?</em></h2>
Well, there are a few reasons:
<ul>
	<li>Every client is different, thus requiring unique media mixes to deliver on their goals</li>
	<li>DSP's &amp; site direct buys provide very different opportunities to reach your target audience</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>But what if we didn't <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have </span>to toe this line?</em></h2>
In a recent <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2182900/trend-digital-marketing-programmatic-premium" target="_blank">ClickZ article written by Data Xu CEO Mike Baker</a>, a hot new topic was brought up: programmatic premium media buying

Programmatic media buying would provide ...
<ul>
	<li>Marketers the ability to serve the right message to the right consumer at the right time, reducing media waste and improving performance</li>
	<li>Publishers could generate better performance &amp; value from their premium inventory positions, helping them protect the cost of the unit</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>As a media buyer, would you be willing to stop buying site direct altogether if a viable programmatic premium option existed?</em></h2>
