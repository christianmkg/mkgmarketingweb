<h2><em>How can you bring simple &amp; brilliant together?</em></h2>
Something that we preach to current and prospective clients of <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com" target="_blank">MKG Media</a>Â is that the creative concept(s) and the communication channel (i.e. the media) should work hand in hand.

To illustrate this point, I regularly use this analogy:
<h2><em>Would you put the Mona Lisa on the side of a porta potty?</em></h2>
The Kit Kat branded park branch above is a great example of combining a fantastic creative concept with a media execution that does the creative justice.
<h2><em>What other cool examples of creative and media have you seen?</em></h2>
Please include a link to the example in our comments section.
