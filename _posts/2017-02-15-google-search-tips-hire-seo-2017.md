<h1>So ... how do you hire an SEO?</h1>
This week Google updated the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35291?hl=en">'Do you need an SEO?'</a> page of their webmaster support center with a video that outlined four key steps all businesses should take once they have decided to hire an SEO expert to help increase their organic search rankings and performance.
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maileohye">Maile Ohye</a>, an 11 year Google veteran and Developer Programs Tech Lead, said that any SEO hiring process should follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
 	<li class="p1">Conduct a 2-way interview with your potential SEO. Check that they seem genuinely interested in you and your business</li>
 	<li class="p1">Check their references.</li>
 	<li class="p1">Ask for (and you'll probably have to pay for) a technical and search audit.</li>
 	<li class="p1">Decide if you want to hire.</li>
</ol>
It's unique for Google Search or Webmasters team to make sure a definitive "Here is how you do XYZ in Google Search" statement. Looking at our own process for discovery and onboarding new SEO customers, these four recommended steps *already exist* in our flow!
<ol>
 	<li>We vote on every client that walks through our doors. The vote (amongst FTE's of MKG) requires a 100% "yes I would like to work with this customer" response or we refer the client to another SEO consultancy. <a href="/about/who/">It's even noted on our website!</a></li>
 	<li>After the initial discovery call, we ask the prospective client to speak to at least one of our customers before going any further in our discussion.</li>
 	<li>Our first order of business when hired is to perform our home grown <a href="/services/search-engine-optimization/">6-Point SEO Audit</a>. We audit technical and HTML aspects of your website, social signals, geographic ranking factors and more. A dummy template of this 6-Point Audit is shared with all prospective clients before they sign an agreement to work with us so they can tangibly see the output.</li>
</ol>
Additionally, Maile actually confirmed that it can take between<a href="https://youtu.be/piSvFxV_M04?t=1m40s"> 4 and 12 months upon hiring the SEO to see results. </a> A <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-rank/">February 2017 hrefs study</a> found that 95%+ of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">*new*</span> pages won't crack a top 10 SERP ranking in the first 12 months they are live, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>but for those that do it can take 2 to 6 months</em></span>. This includes giving that resource time to perform an audit, put a plan in place, deploy changes to production and have search engines crawl and re-index those changes.
