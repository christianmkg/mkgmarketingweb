<p>Too often, websites fail to convey the absolute <i>awesomesauce</i> that a company offers. Simply, it's in how a company chooses to describe their product/offering via the words on their website that can be its downfall.</p>

<p>We wanted to give you the "secret sauce" on how to properly describe your offering on your website, while also giving you the "mustard." Because nobody likes "mustard." The word itself isn't even appealing.</p>

<p>Read on for FIVE words to absolutely make sure are on your website and 5 words to CTRL-F and get rid of immediately.</p>

<h2>5 Words to Use on Your Website</h2>

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/secretsauce.png"><img src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/secretsauce.png" alt="Secret Sauce" width="944" height="491" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4746" border="none"/></a>

<p>These words should be the entire basis of your website. They should be prevalent in headlines, copy and calls to action.</p>

<h2>You</h2>

<p>Regardless of what you're offering, it's all about your customer/client/user/member, isn't it? If a visitor can't understand how your offering fits into their life quickly and painlessly, they will leave.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>

<p>Your offering's value needs to be stated/shown/shoved down a visitor's throat early and often. And if for whatever reason you don't want to use the actual word "value," find a way to succinctly sum up what makes your offering appealing. Will it increase productivity by 20%? Save you $60 over a year? Hold 12 times its weight in liquid?</p>

<p><i>(The ShamWow really is amazing.)</i></p>

<h2>The</h2>

<p>What's this? The word "the?" Believe it. If you truly want to make a headline impactful, add the word "the" to the beginning of it. Watch:</p>

<p><strong>Coffee That Gets Noticed</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Coffee That Gets Noticed</strong></p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p><strong>Destination for the World's Best Cup of Coffee</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Destination for the World's Best Cup of Coffee</strong></p>

<p>The word "the" makes something seem exclusive; just look at the dictionary for "the."

<blockquote>Used to mark a noun as indicating the best-known, most approved, most important, most satisfying, etc.</blockquote>

<h3>Simple</h3>

<p>Do you want more complicated? I don't. As a matter of fact, lots of people are turned off if something seems complicated. Why do you think the iPhone is so popular?

<p><i>*rimshot*</i></p>

<p>People want things fast, easy and they want it to be simple. If your offering isn't simple, there's a straightforward solution: make it <i>seem</i> simple.</p>

<h3>Proven</h3>

<p>The majority of those that surf the Internet are not willing to try something that doesn't have legitimacy. It needs to be proven, and things that are proven help ease the anxiety of visitors who may be on the fence about your offering.</p>

<p>Proven-what, though?</p>

<p>It can actually be proven-anything! Proven 4.5 average app rating on iTunes, proven to increase profits by 15%, etc. The one thing to remember, however, is the word "proven" means to "demonstrate the truth or existence of (something) by evidence or argument." The only way using the word "proven" will work is to prove its existence by providing evidence.</p>

<h3>And now, the "Mustard" - 5 Words to Avoid Using on Your Website</h3>

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mustard.png"><img src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mustard.png" alt="Mustard" width="942" height="443" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4749" /></a>

<h3>Innovative</h3>

<p>Instead of labeling something as innovative, tell the visitor why it's innovative.</p>

<h3>Unique</h3>

<p>Does being unique instantly make something a good thing? If you're using "unique" to describe your offering, find a way to describe it better.</p>

<h3>Original</h3>

<p>This one is tricky! The original is rarely the best option. It's true! And not only that, the original can be outdated pretty easily. If you truly have a groundbreaking offering, I'll let you have this packet of mustard...</p>

<h3>Discover</h3>

<p>Why is the website visitor on your site? Don't tell them what they're already doing...</p>

<h3>Might, Should, Could</h3>

<p>Don't write about what may happen, write about what will happen. Your offering might not improve someone's life, or could be life-changing: it is life-changing and it will improve someone's life. Make sure your verbs are putting website visitors in the right mindset.</p>
