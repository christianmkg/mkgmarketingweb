<img class="size-full wp-image-409 alignleft" title="facebook IPO" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/alg_facebook.jpeg" alt="mark zuckerburg facebook IPO" width="450" height="287" />
<p style="text-align: left;">Today's post will be short, sweet and centered around one of the hottest topics in Sillicon Valley &amp; Wall Street over the past few days:</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">THE FACEBOOK IPO</h2>
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-01/shares-of-facebook-may-be-five-times-as-expensive-as-google-s-in-offering.html" target="_blank">According to Bloomberg</a>, Facebook is seeking a valuation between $75 - $100 billion while attempting to raise $5 billion in cash. This valuation would be more than 5 times larger than the public offering that Google generated in 2004. The difference between settling on a $75 billion valuation or scoring the $100 billion number is absolutely astronomical -- especially for early stage employees who are licking their chops as they calculate the estimated value of their stock options.
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Now what does this have to do with media again, exactly?</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">SIMPLE: SETTING ACCURATE METRICS</h2>
The importance of setting accurate metrics up front, which is something MKG prides itself in doing with current and prospective clients, is of enormous importance.

While MKG may not be buying $75 or $100 billion dollars worth of media for a single client at one time, buying millions of dollars worth of media (which we do happen to do) can still result in setting horrifically underacheiving / overachieving metrics.
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em>The value MKG brings as an agency is in our ability to assist you, the client, in setting aggressive, yet accurate, metrics.</em></h3>
Once we set those metrics, it's off to the races and time for us to go out and crush your current benchmarks.

We look forward to setting metrics with you soon :-) ... And yes, we will consist accepting Facebook stock options as form of payment.
