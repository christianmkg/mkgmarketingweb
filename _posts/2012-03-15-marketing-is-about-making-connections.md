Put on by <a href="http://salesforce.com" target="_blank">Sales Force</a>, the conference brought together start-up founders, marketers and brand leaders from companies like <a href="http://burberry.com" target="_blank">Burberry</a>, <a href="http://toyota.com" target="_blank">Toyota</a>, <a href="http://radian6.com" target="_blank">Radian6</a> &amp; more to discuss the way the social enterprise is quickly shaping how business is conducted today.

But the most important item I'd like to share from the keynote speech comes from a featured keynote speaker ...
<h2><em>Marketing is about making connections</em></h2>
According to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lebrun" target="_blank">Radian6 SVP / GM Marcel LeBrun</a>, marketing is becoming less about ...
<ul>
	<li>
<h4>Impressions</h4>
</li>
	<li>
<h4>CPM's</h4>
</li>
	<li>
<h4>Clicks</h4>
</li>
</ul>
And is becoming more focused on ...
<ul>
	<li>
<h4><em>Creating connections </em>with customers</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Are your marketing partners (media vendors, PR / advertising agencies, etc.) helping you create connections with your customers?</em></h2>
