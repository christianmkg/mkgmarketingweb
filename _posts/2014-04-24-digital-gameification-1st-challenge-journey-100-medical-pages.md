<p>Per our article about the three things we want to do as a team each quarter, I'm kicking off our first health challenge.</p>

<p>In the next few months we're looking to do two things:</p>

<ol>
     <li>Collect 100 medical pages as a team and upload them into our new Free ZHR (Zweena Health Record) by March 31st</li>
     <li>Learn how gamification helped us get to our goal</li>
</ol>

<p>Zweena Health, is on a <a href="http://zweenahealth.com/changing-the-face-of-healthcare-our-journey-to-50000-pages/">journey get 50,000 pages</a> uploaded into their system. This goal is not about pages. It's about helping people get active in their healthcare. Since we came up with the idea as the AOR (agency of record), it's fitting we practice what we preach.</p>

<p>We've learned a lot about healthcare through Zweena Health. The greatest thing we learned from John Phelan, CEO, is the importance of patient engagement. This starts with owning your data.</p>

<p>It's time for us to learn this lesson and become active in our healthcare. We'll start with collecting and uploading our health records into our own ZHRs.</p>

<p>Zweena offers a free version of their personal health record, making it easy to take an active role in your healthcare. Join us! Collect your records, start a free ZHR, and upload your pages.</p>

<p>If we reach this goal, MKG will buy each employee a monthly subscription to Zweena. This will allow each of us to be active in our healthcare all year long.</p>

<p>Besides... <strong>what's gameification without incentive?</strong></p>

<p>Ready. Set. Go!</p>
