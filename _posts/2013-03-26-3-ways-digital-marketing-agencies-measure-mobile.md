As a digital marketing agency that focuses on integrating multiple channels into our clients' marketing mix, we are constantly asked the following:
<blockquote>
<h3>Where does mobile fit in? And how do I measure performance?</h3>
</blockquote>
Based on our experience running mobile marketing campaigns, we wanted to highlight three executions &amp; measurement options:
<h2><strong>Click-to-Call</strong></h2>
<em>The Background<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/click-to-call-ad.jpeg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2362" alt="click to call mobile advertising" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/click-to-call-ad.jpeg" width="302" height="302" /></a></em>

Mobile devices provide a fantastic conversion point: Calling your business!

Think consumers are shy to click the 'call' button on their mobile device?<em> Think again. </em>

BIA/Kelsey research shows that mobile call volume will double by 2014. Additional research has shown that inbound phone calls are <em><strong>15 TIMES</strong> <strong>more likely to convert</strong></em> than a web lead from a download form.

<em>The Execution</em>

So how can your brand create &amp; execute a click-to-call campaign?
<ul>
	<li><em style="line-height: 1.5em;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Mobile Search:Â </span></em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The major search engines (Google, Bing &amp; Yahoo) all support the option to run paid search ads on mobile devices.Â </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Instead of sending users to a mobile landing page, allow them to dial directly in to your business.</span></li>
	<li>Mobile Banner: As users are surfing the internet on their mobile device or engaging with Yelp or a local traffic app, present a banner prompting your customer to click-to-call to learn more about the offering being advertised.</li>
</ul>
<em>The MeasurementÂ </em>

Click-to-call Â performance can be measured by creating a <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/" target="_blank">Google Talk number </a>(free) and connecting with your brands Google AdWords account.

When a customer dials the phone number or clicks on an mobile search or banner ad, Google AdWords will capture that action.
<h2><strong>SMS Marketing</strong></h2>
<em>The Background<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SMS-marketing-screenshot.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2359 alignright" alt="SMS database opt-in mobile marketing" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SMS-marketing-screenshot.jpeg" width="185" height="185" /></a></em>

Short Message Service (SMS) marketing encourages customers to 'opt in' to receive special offers, updates &amp; additional information from a brand via a text message on their mobile device.

<em>The Execution</em>

Similar to email marketing in that the objective is to capture &amp; nurture a direct line of communication with your audience, SMS marketing flourishes when there are location-specific or limited time offers. Great examples include:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">"2-for-1 fish tacos during happy hour!"</span></li>
	<li>"New location! Come get FREE taco with beverage purchase during lunch!"</li>
</ul>
<em>The Measurement</em>

SMS marketing also helps bridge the gap between digital &amp; offline, as success is typically measured in actual number of offers redeemed at a physical location.
<h2><strong style="color: #443322; font-family: Asap, Verdada, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.2em;">Database Marketing</strong></h2>
<em>The Background</em>

Similar to SMS marketing, the focus of mobile database marketing is to capture 'opt in' leads to begin nurturing via a CRM or email marketing program.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The real value of database marketing is to create unique segments across platforms (mobile, tablet, PC), channels (CRM, online ads, mobile advertising, etc) &amp; audience segments (B2B audience ... B2G audience ... etc)</span>

<em>The Execution</em>

Database marketing is a classic give-and-take exchange: In exchange for you, the customer's, email address, we the brand will deliver you an offer via email.

Take a look at the example on the right:<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2368" alt="mobile marketing database email opt in" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/database-opt-in.jpeg" width="271" height="186" />
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Brand would like to acquire customers' email addresses</span></li>
	<li>In exchange for that information, they will provide a $10 coupon for every $30 the customer spends at the restaurant</li>
</ol>
<em>The Measurement</em>

Database marketing campaigns can drive toward multiple goals and objectives, but here are a few of the more valuable metrics to determine success on mobile database marketing campaigns:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Conversion Rates, such as number of opt ins divided by number offers redeemed</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Â Life Time Value, by continuing to measure redemption for eachÂ </span><span style="line-height: 21px;">individual</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Â opt-in customer</span></li>
	<li>Revenue per Redemption, to determine high value audiences &amp; promotions</li>
</ul>
