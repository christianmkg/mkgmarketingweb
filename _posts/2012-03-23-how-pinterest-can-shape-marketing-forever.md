Reese Witherspoon told the world that it was a "collection of the most amazing, wonderful craftiness on earth" on the Conan O'Brien show.

The U.S. Army has issued a Pinterest 'how-to guide', as it's been described.
<h2><em>Pinterest is here to stay.</em></h2>
In February 2012, Pinterest drove more referral traffic than Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn &amp; YouTube ... <strong>combined.</strong>
<h2><em>Yet investor extraordinaire Andreessen Horowitz <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/10/venture-capital-deals-21/" target="_blank">nearly passed on the company.</a></em></h2>
What changed his mind?

A female researcher on staff tugged relentlessly on his sleeve and urged him to reconsider.
<h2><em>So what's the point here?</em></h2>
The point is this: Pinterest is the perfect example of a product / service that blew up by reaching what was initially thought of as an unprofitable or non-existant market.

Take this quote from Andreessen: <em>"Our industry historically â€¦ do we produce products initially aimed primarily at men or women? You'd have to say men."</em>

<strong>And he's right:</strong> Brands have the ability to become complacent with their current audience, which could lead to them missing out onÂ previously unseen target segments.
<h2><em>Is your brand missing a critical / undiscovered piece of your target audience?</em></h2>
