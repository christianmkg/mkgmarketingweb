<h2>Background Info</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Last week, one of our medical clients asked the question, "How do I know if I am using Twitter correctly?"</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">It becameÂ apparentÂ to our marketing team here atÂ <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/" target="_blank">MKG Media Group</a>Â that they could benefit from a Twitter Best Practices guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">If you have asked yourself a similar question, then you can benefit too! There are many ways to write an effective Tweet; the versatility of Twitter makes it a powerful marketing tool.Â Use this outline as a guide, keeping in mind that these recommendation are not set in stone.</p>

<h2>Why Twitter?</h2>
You may be new to Twitter, so before I show you the <em>how</em>, I want to explain the <em>why</em>Â behind it.

Twitter is a social media network that lets users share messages and ideas to an engaged, highly targeted audience.

Twitter may have just turned seven years old this year, but it is not aÂ fledglingÂ marketing channel. There are roughlyÂ <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-21/business/37889387_1_tweets-jack-dorsey-twitter" target="_blank">400 million tweets sent everyday</a>Â and as of 2012,<a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-active-total-users_b17655" target="_blank">Â Twitter had 140 million active users with over 500 million registered users.Â </a>It's a big deal!

Now lets jump into the anatomy of a tweet using a real example...see below:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Top Tech Trends in Healthcare:</span>Â <span style="color: #339966;">Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Act,<span style="color: #ff0000;">Â </span></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">via @jamiechurchill</span>Â <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&gt; ow.ly/lFkPR</span>Â <span style="color: #993366;">#healthIT #ACA</span></strong></p>
Let's walk through each step, which I've color coded for your reference:
<h2 style="color: #0000ff;">Step 1: Subject</h2>
In this example, "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><b><a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/healthcare/blog/2013/05/30/top-technology-trends-in-healthcare-may-2013/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Top Tech Trends in Healthcare</span></a></b></span>"<b>,</b>Â is the title of the article I am referencing; this article outlines a list of the top five tech trends in healthcare today.Â  It is not necessary to copy the article title word-for-word; in fact, I would recommend you modify it slightly otherwise you may appear "spammy" and automated.

The reason it works well here isÂ because the article is a list of tech trends, and lists are sticky! They are simple to understand, quickly read and they do a great job of summarizing complicated or lengthy information.
<h2 style="color: #008000;">Step 2: Sub-Title: Give the Audience Direction</h2>
The sub-title,Â <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Act</strong></span>, helps the reader know what he/she is about to read. It is important that we create proper expectations for our audience. If you create a punchy title that has little to do with the actual article, the audience will feel duped when they visit your website!

It is important to engage with your audience and provide value. By creating relevant titles and sub-titles, we create proper expectations for our audience. Sub-titles are not always necessary; a great title can stand-alone.
<h2 style="color: #ff0000;">Step 3: Giving Credit To Author</h2>
Similar to a work-cited page, it's important to give credit where credit is due. The â€œ<span style="color: #ff0000;">via</span>â€ is an example of a correct way to reference the author. Always include a space after it when composing your tweets.

Furthermore, by placing the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">@</span>" sign directly in front of the authorâ€™s twitter handle, my <i>tweet</i> will show up inÂ <span style="color: #ff0000;">jamiechurchill</span>'s interactionÂ stream. This increases engagement with that message -- wahoo! I always search Google or Twitter to ensure I have the correct Twitter handle.
<h2 style="color: #ff00ff;">Step 4: Referencing the Article</h2>
The arrow â€œ<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><b>&gt;</b></span>â€, signifies the reference to the online article. It needs a space before and after the link. "<span style="color: #ff00ff;"><a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/healthcare/blog/2013/05/30/top-technology-trends-in-healthcare-may-2013/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><b>ow.ly/lFkPR</b></span></a></span>"Â is a shortened URL from the original website article. Include a space after the link.

At <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/" target="_blank">MKG Media Group</a> we use <a title="Squeeze" href="http://squeezecmm.com/default.aspx">sqz.co</a> to shrink URLs, which allows us to see which content drove actual conversions. There are several other tools like Bit.ly and Ow.ly that will shorten and track clicks.

Follow this <a href="http://www.cssrex.com/tips-tricks/top-25-url-shortener-tools-websites/" target="_blank">link</a> to see the top 25 URL shortening tools.

<strong>Note:</strong> If you are Tweeting from a mobile phone, shortening the URL is not an option. You can still include a link from a phone, however, it will be cut off. Â Viewers can still click on the link and it will function correctly. <a href="http://www.cssrex.com/tips-tricks/top-25-url-shortener-tools-websites/">
</a>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">Step 5: Hashtags</h2>
Last but not least, the infamous Twitter hashtags.Â  Hashtags are case sensitive, so pay attention to how they appear on Twitter.

Hashtags should always be relevant to the article and the target audience. It is important to hashtag terms toÂ positionÂ your message in front of the right audience; but stay away from tagging more than five terms in a single tweet because it looks "spammy".

In the color coded example above, I include hashtags at the end. However, you can tagÂ words throughout the title as well. Tagging words in the title is useful when you are running out of space. Below are a few examples of hashtags used in different positions within a tweet<i><strong>:</strong></i>
<ul>
	<li style="line-height: 1.5em;">Stage 2 #MU: 10% Patient Use of #EHR to Qualify -- Should Raise Public Awareness of EHR Providers? Thoughts? @CMSGov &gt;Â <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://ow.ly/lMIZh">http://ow.ly/lMIZh</a></li>
	<li>#bluebutton Will Be a Game Changer @Rypanhair &amp; @rypan ... #HealthIT Will Focus on Patient-Centric #healthcare Moving Forward. You agree?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> These are Influencer Engagement tweets and the format varies slightly from the above outline.
