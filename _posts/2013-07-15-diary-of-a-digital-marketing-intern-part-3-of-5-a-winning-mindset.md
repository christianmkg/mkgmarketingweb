<p>Last week in the<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/diary-of-a-digital-marketing-intern-doin-work/" target="_blank">Â second part of this five part series</a>, I gave you a snap-shot of my responsibilities here at <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/" target="_blank">MKG Media Group</a>Â and shared some technical learning aspects related to those roles.</p>
<p>I'm glad I wrote that blog last week, because if I had waited until now...it would've been twice as long!</p>
<p>In the third part of this series, I'll share my mindset as an intern and how it has helped me make the most of this experience.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Mindset of an Effective Intern</h3>
<p>I am going to share six ideas that have helped me be an effective intern. These include:</p>
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Positive Attitude</span></li>
	<li>Active Learning</li>
	<li>Provide a Service</li>
	<li>Be Professional</li>
	<li>Take Pride</li>
	<li>Have Fun</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's jump right into my attitude:</p>

<h3>1. The Power of a Positive Attitude</h3>
<p>Attitude matters! I don't <strong>'have'</strong> to go to work each day, I <strong>'get'</strong> to go to work each day. The minute you view work as an obligation instead of an opportunity, you need to change your attitude.</p>

<p>Having a positive attitude is a choice; it's aÂ consciousÂ decision we make every day. I learned this while working 3 consecutive summers with theÂ <a href="http://www.southwestern.com/" target="_blank">Southwestern Company</a>, where I logged over 3,000 hours of direct sales work and over 10,000 face-to-face cold calls. That experience convinced me that one's attitude towards work, problem solving, relationships and life in general, is the key determinant to his or her success.</p>

<p>Experts say that the attitude you exude in the first ten seconds of your day has a dramatic impact on your attitude for the rest of the day. Working with the <a href="http://www.southwestern.com/" target="_blank">Southwestern Company</a>, I developed the habit of jumping out of bed and saying out loud, "It's gonna be a great day!" Yes, I talk to myself. Your attitude, good or bad, is contagious; use that to your advantage.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip: Three things to say to yourself in the mirror each morning:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>"It's gonna be a great day!"</li>
	<li>Â "You good looking thing...don't you ever die on me!"</li>
	<li>Â "Good Mornin' Winner!"</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Be A Sponge</h3>
<p>Create the habit of loving to learn.</p>

<p>Working in an office with two marketingÂ professionals like <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikekrass" target="_blank">Mike Krass</a> &amp;Â <a href="http://kerryguard.com/" target="_blank">Kerry Guard</a>, I am surrounded with years of marketingÂ expertise.</p>

<p>To say that I work amidst a "steep learning curve" is anÂ understatement. That being the case, it is important for me to be humble, coachable, and a great listener. To be a sponge means to listen, ask questions and actively engage in every learning opportunity.</p>

<p>I have only eight weeks to learn all I can about digital marketing. Because my time here is limited, being a sponge, that is, being eager to learn, is especially important.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip: There are no stupid questions, only stupid people.</strong></p>
<blockquote>It is better to ask a question and appear stupid, than to not ask a questionÂ and be stupid.</blockquote>

<h3>3. Service Minded</h3>
<p>IÂ constantlyÂ ask myself, "What value am I providing for the team?" It is important for me not to confuse <strong>activity</strong> with <strong>productivity</strong>. My goal is toÂ always provide value through the work I perform.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip: "If you help enough people reach their goals, in the process, you will reach your own."</strong></p>
<p>This quote from the great,Â <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-ritzer/7/a29/b6" target="_blank">Tim Ritzer</a>,Â District Sales Manager at theÂ <a href="http://www.southwestern.com/" target="_blank">Southwestern Company</a>, said to meÂ during my pursuit to be an effective Assistant Organizational Manager while still reaching personal sales goals, has shaped my attitude towards providing a service for others.</p>

<h3>4. Be Professional</h3>
<p>For me, being professional means the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Do what I say I will do and honor my word </span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Dress for the job I want, notÂ necessarilyÂ the one I have </span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Take pride inÂ effectivelyÂ communicating and beingÂ punctual </span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Do my best with a positive attitude</span></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, doing your best is all that matters; no one will ever doubt your character when you do your best.</span>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: "Being a professional means doing your job regardless of how you feel. Emotions fluctuate; be a master of your emotions and go to work."</strong></p>

<h3>5. Personal Pride</h3>
<p>Taking pride in all I do is really a culmination of theÂ previousÂ four points. My work effort not only represents me personally as an young professional, but it also representsÂ <a href="http://ideamensch.com/mario/" target="_blank">Mario Schulzke</a>,Â whoÂ referredÂ me for this job, as well as theÂ <a href="http://www.umt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Montana</a>Â as a whole.</p>

<p>I want <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/" target="_blank">MKG</a> to feel so great about their decision to hire their first intern that they hire another. If I do my job right, that intern will hopefully come from the <a href="http://www.business.umt.edu/" target="_blank">School of Business</a> at the University of Montana. I recognize that doing my best this summer will positively impact others besides me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: Take pride in every action you perform, the impact is far reaching.</strong></p>
<blockquote>We sow our thoughts, and we reap our actions; we sow our actions, and we reap our habits; we sow our habits, and we reap our characters; we sow our characters, and we reap our destiny<cite>Wayne S. Peterson</cite></blockquote>

<h3>6. Let the Fun Times Roll!</h3>

<p>Having a good attitude, loving what I'm learning, providing a service for others and living outside of my comfort zone in San Francisco - all these are the perfect ingredients for a huge glass of pleased-as-punch!</p>
<p>I enjoy doin' digital marketing work at my job, but I try not to lose sight of having fun. Being present and grateful for this experience allows me to really enjoy the moment. I take my job seriously, but I try not to take myself too seriously. This means giving high fives to the bosses at work,Â getting lostÂ in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/prsf/index.htm" target="_blank">Presidio Park</a>Â on the weekend, and adventuring to the <a href="http://www.santacruz.org/things/beaches.php?gclid=COyvnvrvpbgCFUQ6QgodjnsAKQ" target="_blank">Santa Cruz Beach</a>Â with a group ofÂ <a href="http://www.wesoldbooks.com/s/236/start.aspx" target="_blank">Southwestern Alumni </a>(we're everywhere!).</p>
<p>Throughout my time here, I constantly ask myself the following question:</p>
<blockquote>"What kind of summer do you want to create?"</blockquote>
<p>I know the answer is "the best summer of my life!" That will be a challenge, given my hard-to-beat experience with Southwestern, but I am well on my way.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: In all that you do in life, don't forget to create fun and enjoyment.</strong></p>
<p>Next week in the fourth part of this series I will explain my thoughts on the benefits of working for a small business.</p>
