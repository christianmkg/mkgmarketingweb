Google's emphasis on ensuring mobile users get the best experience from Google Search continues today.

Google has now pushed live its <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> format project live on the mobile news carousel.

See below for a screenshot of what that looks like:

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AMP.png" rel="attachment wp-att-5732"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5732" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AMP-1024x573.png" alt="AMP SEO" width="1024" height="573" /></a>

As annotated, two things to look for in this example:
<ol>
	<li>AN AMP result has a visual cue.</li>
	<li>AMP results outrank non-AMP results.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What Does This Mean For Google</h2>
<i>More skin in the mobile user focus game</i>.

Last year, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8558535/google-mobile-search-vs-desktop" target="_blank">they said that mobile users now outnumber desktop users in 10 countries</a>.

To take it one step further,<a href="http://yourstory.com/2016/02/mobile-users-growth/" target="_blank"> Google India projects that 80% of users will be mobile in 2017</a>.

With these numbers and projects, you bet your AMP that Google is gearing up <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-search-market-share-67-percent-pc-83-percent-mobile-203937" target="_blank">to continue to be the mobile search engine destination of choice</a>. 83% of mobile search engine user market share only means they want to capture 17% more.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Think about it</span>: search engines are in the business of not only delivering the most relevant results for a query but also delivering a fantastic user experience from search --&gt; external click.

If you click on a result and it takes a long time to load, without thinking about it, <em>you attribute this poor UX to the search engine</em> and not necessarily to the web page that is loading.

<strong>Google realizes this</strong>. And while the relevancy of their results can be debated, they're obviously taking huge strides in ensuring fast delivery of content.
<h2>What Does This Mean as a Google User</h2>
<em>A better user experience!</em> No one wants to sit around and wait for page loads; with AMP format pages, the HTML used is incredibly lightweight.

The load will be darn near instantaneous.

Which is good for users on mobile devices who might not be hooked up to WiFi and are on their carrier's LTE (or otherwise) network.

Google understands the future is mobile. <a href="http://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-mobile-friendly-update" target="_blank">#Mobilegeddon in April last year</a> - <em>although not nearly delivering the kind of impact we all expected</em> - set the table for Google to show that they are very laser-focused on mobile users.

AMP format<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> is simply a natural evolution of this focus</span>.
<h2>What Does This Mean as a Webmaster / Publisher</h2>
If you get any kind of quantifiable mobile traffic, <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create_page.html" target="_blank">you should look into creating AMP pages of your site</a>.

Now, first a quick caveat:

It appears like these AMP results are showing up in the mobile news carousel for certain queries.

I had to Google "Donald Trump" in order to find an example. Inexplicably, Googling "Guantanamo Bay" did not show any AMP results. Neither did a non-news specific query ("Vancouver Canucks").

This is the first day of Google's AMP rollout so obviously results aren't going to be consistent.
<h2>AMP Checklist: What You Should Do Today</h2>
The following is an exercise you should look to do so you can determine if any current pages need to be created in AMP format or if you should look to be creating AMP format pages for future content.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1</strong></span> - Go into your analytics platform and look at traffic by organic traffic by mobile vs desktop.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MKG-analytics.png" rel="attachment wp-att-5735"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5735 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MKG-analytics-300x199.png" alt="Organic search traffic by device - google analytics" width="300" height="199" /></a>

<em>If you have a sizable number of mobile users, start getting your AMP page list ready.</em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2</strong></span> - Go into top landing pages by organic traffic. Jot down the URLs that have higher numbers.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mkg-analytics2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-5736"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5736" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mkg-analytics2-240x300.png" alt="Top landing pages by organic search - google analytics" width="240" height="300" /></a>

<em>Identified five pages - aside from our home page - that are popular organic search traffic landing pages.</em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3</strong></span> - Use<a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create_page.html"> the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project creation tool</a> to help you create AMP format pages for the URLs you found in step 2.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AMP-get-started.png" rel="attachment wp-att-5738"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5738" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AMP-get-started-300x214.png" alt="Accelerated Mobile Pages Project - Get Started" width="300" height="214" /></a>

<em>If you found that you have a sizable number of organic search traffic sessions to your site, think about implementing an action plan to get AMP format pages released alongside new pages you are producing.</em>
<h2>Get AMP or Get Out</h2>
Know that this initiative is supported by all kinds of publishers. Maybe you've heard of a couple?<em> (Spoiler: you definitely have - <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">this is just a small slice of the overall number</a>)</em>

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/publishers.png" rel="attachment wp-att-5739"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5739" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/publishers-300x134.png" alt="AMP format SEO - publishers" width="300" height="134" /></a>

And I'm sure you haven't heard of any of the technology partners:

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/technology-partners.png" rel="attachment wp-att-5740"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5740" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/technology-partners-300x170.png" alt="AMP format - technology partners" width="300" height="170" /></a>

Basically: it's time to get your tickets to this train ride. Because today is just the beginning of how important AMP format will be to mobile.
