As the title of this post &amp; graphic above suggests, this article sets out to ask brands if they understand the journey customers make from the beginning to end of a purchase process.

We should probably establish a baseline, so I'll ask you all ...
<h2><em>Does your brand understand a 'day in the life' of its target consumers?</em></h2>
If the answer is yes, then we'd love to hear your opinion on our advice below.

If the answer is maybe (or even the brave <em><strong>'no'</strong></em> respondent out there), then we'd like to provide you with some direction to assist your brand / agency as you attempt to answer this question.
<h2><em>A couple good questions to evaluate your customer journeyÂ competencyÂ include ...</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Value: </strong>Finding, integrating &amp; focusing your brands value on the customers life</li>
	<li><strong>Environmental: </strong>Which physical and/or interactive touch points does your customer base interact with your brand?</li>
	<li><strong>Channel Selection: </strong>Similar to environmental, have you taken a deeper dive to understand which channels your customer base is predisposed to use?</li>
</ul>
While there are many more examples of actionable items to begin answering your customer journey conundrum, the three noted above should provide your organization with a great baseline to get the conversation started.
<h2><em>On top of the advice listed above, here a few resources to refer to ...</em></h2>
