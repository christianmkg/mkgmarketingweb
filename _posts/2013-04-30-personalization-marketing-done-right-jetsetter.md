Dear <a title="JetSetter" href="http://jetsetter.com" target="_blank">JetSetter</a>, a Premium Hotel Booking Website:

I would just like to commend you for the awesomeness that is your digital marketing, which features a heavy does of <strong>personalization marketing</strong>.

Not only did you deliver me a re-targeting ad on Facebook after I visited your website, but it was personalized with a hotel that I had <em>JUST looked at</em>.Â  I'm impressed.

On top of the ad being personalized to my browsing tastes, you accomplished a lot in just 90 characters.

In three steps, let's break down the anatomy of your Facebook ad:

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/JetSetter-Facebook-Ad.png"><img alt="JetSetter Facebook Ad" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/JetSetter-Facebook-Ad.png" width="269" height="126" /></a>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Title:</strong> Your Company Name - A good start as I've already been to your site so now I recognize who is talking to me</li>
	<li><strong>Image:</strong> Picture of the hotel I was looking at - A little busy for a thumbnail image, but I get the sense of ambiance</li>
	<li><strong>Body:</strong> Name of the hotel to remind me what I looked at ... <em>check</em>.Â  Price of the hotel, <em>check</em>. Sense of urgency, <em>check</em>.</li>
</ol>
I clicked on the ad to make sure your personalization followed through to the website, and it did! You took me right to the Hudson Hotel landing page of your website.

<a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-29-at-8.17.02-PM.png"><img alt="Jet Setter Personalized Marketing Landing Page" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-29-at-8.17.02-PM.png" width="683" height="870" /></a>

The only blunder I see is the <em>price listed is not the price from your ad</em>. Because it's such a 33% price difference ($120) it could cost you a user to bounce.

On top of your ad being clear, concise, and to the point, so is your landing page. Travel websites take note of the following:
<ul>
	<li>Big pictures</li>
	<li>Clean background</li>
	<li>Easy &amp; fun navigation for checking availability</li>
	<li>Big, eye-catching buttons</li>
	<li>Easily shareable</li>
</ul>
Thank you Jetsetter for showing us marketers how <strong>Personalization Marketing</strong> is really done.
