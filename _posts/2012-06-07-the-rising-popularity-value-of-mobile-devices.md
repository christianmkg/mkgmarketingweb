<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1329" title="The new Nokia smart phone Lumia 800 is shown off at Nokia world, London" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/mobile-phone.jpeg" alt="" width="492" height="330" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How much time are you spending on your mobile device?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to a<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/this-graph-is-disastrous-for-print-and-great-for-facebook-or-the-opposite/257857/" target="_blank"> recent article in The Atlantic</a>, 10% of users time is spent on mobile devices.Â Why is this a relevant statistic?</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><em>Because while users spend 10% of their time on mobile devices, only 1% of ad spend is dedicated to these devices</em></h2>
Take a look at the graph below:
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1330" title="time spent chart" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/time-spent-chart.png" alt="mobile tv print digital" width="407" height="318" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With such a great disparity in time spent and advertising spend, we still believe that mobile marketing is the future of media and advertising.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here's why ...</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><em>Diversity of Tactics on Mobile Devices</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Agencies &amp; brands have a plethora of mobile tactics to choose from to deliver their product message and brand experience to the target audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We can thank advancements in the followingÂ tacticsÂ that now help us moreÂ efficientlyÂ generate brand awareness, product consideration, purchase &amp; brand loyalty.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mobile ad units</li>
	<li>Mobile search</li>
	<li>Mobile apps</li>
	<li>Mobile web</li>
	<li>SMS marketing</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Mobile Experimentation Leading to New Opportunities</em></h2>
We discussed the rise of <a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/location-based-apps-at-sxswi" target="_blank">social discovery apps like Highlight and Banjo in a previous blog post</a>, and while many users label these ideas as 'creepy', the concepts behind social discovery are great fuel to the fire for others looking to expand the value of GPS-specific capabilities, open-graphÂ technologiesÂ and social web as a whole.
<h2><em>Mobile's Influence on Society as a Whole</em></h2>
More than two-thirds of mobile users time on their device is spent conducting non-communication activities.

Great examples of this fact include ...
<ul>
	<li>American's spend 94 minutes per day on mobile applications</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/why-mobile-will-dominate-the-future-of-media-and-advertising/258069/" target="_blank">According to this article in </a><em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/06/why-mobile-will-dominate-the-future-of-media-and-advertising/258069/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>, </em>mobile is poised to surpass television as the primary access point for media consumption</li>
</ul>
Each year, users rely on their mobile device more heavily as a source of information (as well as communication). As the mobile experience continues to improve, we believe that this reliance will continue to grow.
<h2><em>Don't believe us?</em></h2>
Well, then take into consideration the fact that there will be <a href="http://searchengineland.com/forecast-more-us-mobile-web-users-than-pc-by-2015-92516" target="_blank">more mobile web users than desktop web by 2015</a>.
<h2><em>Is your brand prepared to embrace communicating with consumers on their mobile device?</em></h2>
