First of all, we don't claim to be the end-all-be-all of digital media &amp; marketing knowledge ... Far from it, in fact.

We consume a large amount of industry newsletters, attend events (like yesterdays<a href="marketing-is-about-making-connections" target="_blank"> Cloud Force conference post</a>) and grab drinks with marketers coast-to-coast while discussing the latest and greatest.

Yes, our lives are so difficult :-)
<h2><em>As a gift to you and yours on this Friday afternoon, here are four of the best digital marketing resources on the web.</em></h2>
<h2>1. ClickZ</h2>
<a href="http://www.clickz.com/" target="_blank">ClickZ</a> publishes daily content and delivers newsletters about media planning &amp; buying, analytics, trainings / white papers &amp; interactive jobs direct to users inboxes every single morning.

They also have <a href="http://www.clickz.com/stats" target="_blank"><em>extremely </em>handy tools </a>that we've used to explain media math and walk clients through the calculation of success metrics.
<h2>iMedia Connection</h2>
<a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/" target="_blank">iMedia Connection</a> works to connect the entire marketing community in a two-part strategy:
<ul>
	<li>Content: Like ClickZ, iMedia publishes daily content on digital marketing &amp; media on a daily basis to keep users up to date on the latest and greatest</li>
	<li>Events: iMedia hosts regular events (iMedia Agency Summit, Brand Summit, Mom's Summit, etc) that cater to specific focuses or verticals within marketing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Digital Tonto</h2>
The brain child of <a href="http://www.digitaltonto.com/" target="_blank">Greg Satell</a>, Digital Tonto is a niche digital marketing blog that discusses media, optimization &amp; technology all from one crisp, coherent voice (enter: Greg Satell).

Digital Tonto is a refreshing place to read up on industry news as well as the actual human experience of working in this industry.
<h2>AdExchanger</h2>
An extremely niche resource, <a href="http://www.adexchanger.com/" target="_blank">AdExchanger</a> focuses on ideas around digital media optimization.

On top of that, AdExchanger aggregates various trainings, resources, job listings &amp; industry events.

Last but not least, they also release a regular 'state of the industry' post that details influentials in the community changing jobs, starting companies, as well as any other big headlines that just happened.
<h2><em>So there you have it ... Happy Friday!</em></h2>
