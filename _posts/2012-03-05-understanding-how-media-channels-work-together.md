One of the main advantages of bringing an agency on board to help clients co-pilot their marketing efforts is simple: <em>overall business strategy.</em>
<h3><em>Instead of relying on limited staff / resources internally to create strategies &amp; pull together advertising results, a client can lean on the agency to provide this service.</em></h3>
From a mediaÂ standpoint, this means understanding how each media channel works together to drive success, which can be measured using sales, lead generation sign ups or site visits, to name a few.
<h3><em>Use the graphic below as a visual example of how media channels can be individually measured.</em></h3>
