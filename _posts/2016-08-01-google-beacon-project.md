<h1 dir="ltr">Can marketers measure a retail visitas the result of seeing an ad online?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Wondered how Google media products like AdWords or YouTube could measure in-store visits?</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">With their Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacons (BLE) beta product, now you can measure when someone views/clicks on your ad <em>and then </em>actually makes it into a retail store.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Google is calling this the <em>Beacon Project </em>for short.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">What are beacons?</h2>

Beacons are small, battery ­powered Bluetooth wireless radios that send one­ way signals intended to be discovered by nearby devices.

Beacons transmit small bits of data like a random number or unique URL roughly once per second. These signals are readable by BLE­ compatible devices, like smartphones and tablets, within a limited proximity range. Apps with the appropriate Bluetooth permissions can read these signals and perform some action.

The slide below (provided by Google) provides some context.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-are-Google-Beacons-MKG-Marketing-Inc.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5921" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/What-are-Google-Beacons-MKG-Marketing-Inc.png" alt="What are Google Beacons? MKG Marketing Inc" width="663" height="373" /></a>
<h2>Why should marketers care about beacons?</h2>
By leveraging Google's beacons marketers can:
<ul>
 	<li>Mark physical places and objects that are important to your business</li>
 	<li>Give those "offline", tangible places/objects meaning</li>
 	<li>Serve online (Desktop/Tablet/Mobile) ads via Google Search, YouTube, Display and Video. Then track a physical action in a retail environment</li>
</ul>
Allow me to translate these three bullets into plain English using the example of a supermarket:
<ul>
 	<li>Place Google beacons at the store entrance, produce aisle and meat department at every store</li>
 	<li>Connect BLE signals to Google AdWords account</li>
 	<li>Serve Google Search and Video ads promoting great deals on produce and meat ... and then <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">actually see</span> </em>how many online users walk into your store and make it to those sections of the market</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does this differ from location-based capabilities we're used to today?</h2>

<h2>Wait ... so y'all can connect online advertising directly to offline actions?</h2>
YES!
<h2>Ahhh now I see the catch: Google is going to charge us for the install and maintenance of the BLEs right?</h2>
NOPE. During this beta period Google will cover 100% of the beacon cost and install.
<h2>Wow that's great! How do we learn if we are eligible for this beta program from Google?</h2>
First and foremost<a href="/mkg-google-premier-agency-partner/"> you need to be working with a Google Premier partner (MKG is one).</a>

<p dir="ltr">Second of all: the pilot is available to merchants in the United States and Canada. If you are interested in the <span class="il">beacons</span> opportunity MKG can submit your brand for consideration.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Third and most important:</strong> if you fill out the Google form below, we can send you two confidential "how it works" documents and schedule a call with Google to submit your brand for consideration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We <strong>**promise**</strong> not to add your information to any database or contact you with any other information besides the Google beacon project.</p>
