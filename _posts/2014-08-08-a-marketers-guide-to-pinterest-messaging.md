<p>Pinterest recently released a messaging feature within their network. At first blush, you may be confused; Pinterest is a site all about pinning stuff you find, right? Well, you may find it surprising that Pinterest says pinners use their “send a pin” feature (introduced last year) <strong>over 2 million times a day</strong>. Pinners are interacting and adding a fully-fledged messaging tool is the next step.</p>

<p>Compared to other messengers in social media...</p>

<h2>Pinterest messaging could be the biggest game-changer for marketers.</h2>

<p>Let’s begin with a lovely overview video from the self-described visual discovery tool:</p>

<p>Not enough time for a video? Handy bullet points below:
<ul>
<li>Now, whenever you send a pin/board/pinner’s profile to a fellow pinner, it puts whatever you send <i>natively</i> into a 1-on-1-conversation thread.</li><br>
<li>And by <i>natively</i> I truly mean it; you can follow, like, repin and send from within the messaging area just like you would anywhere else on the Pinterest site!</li><br>
<li>Gone are the days of sending a pin with little or no context – you can send text messages along with pins/boards/pinners within the messaging app.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>But what does this mean for marketers?</p>

<h2>Pinterest just got personal.</h2>

<p><a href="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/top-gun-style.gif"><img src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/top-gun-style.gif" alt="top-gun-style" width="500" height="281" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4786" /></a></p>

<p>The days of companies repinning or liking and merely hoping somebody notices are over. Pinterest’s new messaging feature is as significant as being able to @reply someone on Twitter. Brands can now <strong>engage</strong> fans, potential customers and influencers. Here are some marketing ideas to get your gears turning.</p>

<p><strong>How Your Brand Can Take Advantage of Pinterest Messaging</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Noticed somebody pinned a product from your ecommerce website? Let them know it’s on sale (especially if their board is “I need this” or something similar). Why is this a good idea? <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/5-pinterest-stats-consider" target="_blank">Pinterest generates 4x more revenue (per click) than Twitter and 27% more per click than Facebook</a>. Pinterest leads to sales.</li><br>
<li>Have you found a pinner who’s interested in your brand’s niche? Follow them (to make them aware of you and hopefully follow something of yours back) and then send them a message. Include an applicable board, pin or fellow pinner that would benefit them to follow in that message, give them something that benefits them.</li><br>
<li>Do you pin your company’s blog posts on Pinterest? If you know your loyal customers or fans on Pinterest, send them a message and ask them to check it out. Start a conversation!</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Pinterest has not only given its users a powerful new tool to interact, but also marketers. I sincerely hope, as marketers, Pinterest messaging doesn’t turn into spamming every follower your boards have. If you’re messaging people just to message them, <strong>you’re doing it wrong</strong>. This fantastic new feature should be used to make connections and have conversations on Pinterest.</p>
