<strong>Name: </strong>Jay Friendman

<strong>Position: </strong>Managing Director / COO

<strong>Company:Â </strong><a href="http://www.goodwaygroup.com/" target="_blank">Goodway Group</a>
<h2></h2>
<h2><em>What is the most difficult piece of your digital media operation to explain to a potential client? How do you overcome this obstacle?</em></h2>
Ad serving without a doubt because it is the central nervous system of all display/mobile/video.Â  Ad serving drives bidding, auctions, RTB, creative testing, dynamic creative, and a whole host of other elements of digital media that make digital media so malleable and successful.

So many people Iâ€™ve spoken to simply canâ€™t get their head around the fact that 1,000 bids can pour into a system to decision bids and creative in .12 seconds and that within .4 seconds all the decisioning is done and the ad is on its way to serving â€“ all without the user realizing what is being done as the page loads.

But, to understand digital media outside of SEM and affiliate this is required knowledge.Â  Iâ€™ll also say that any time Iâ€™ve taken the time to explain how this works Iâ€™ve never had anyone walk away confused.Â  Itâ€™s not that hard once itâ€™s put into laymanâ€™s terms.
<h2><em>Whatâ€™s the biggest problem with the media industry today? How is your company addressing it?</em></h2>
I wonâ€™t speak to media overall but Iâ€™ll respond to the digital ecosystem within all media.Â  I honestly believe one of the biggest problems in digital media is the notion that it is actually a good thing to bash our industry publicly by leaders within our industry.Â  Not one week passes without seeing an article or quote from a speech from an industry thought leader that details all of the â€œproblemsâ€ with our industry and why they donâ€™t blame clients for not spending more in digital.Â  This is ridiculous.Â  Who does this?

First, pointing out problems while providing solutions is a good thing.Â  Pointing out problems without solutions is awful.

Second, most of these comments are wrong anyway.Â  Take the notion of â€œbanner blindnessâ€.Â  Really? People donâ€™t see banners anymore?Â  Then why does brand study after brand study show improvements in all major brand metrics throughout a campaign?

More examples are available via our blog.
<h2><em>Where do you see digital media going in the next year? 5 years? 10 years?</em></h2>
This one is easy.Â  Programmatic buying (real time decisioning/bidding on an impression by impression, user by user basis) is the biggest and most radical change to happen to the media agency business since computers were put on buyersâ€™ desktops.

Those who master programmatic buying will win the digital game and ultimately the TV game.Â  TV will ultimately become programmatically buyable and insertable.Â  Itâ€™s the current holy grail.Â  Right now content creators and delivery companies (cable/ATS/fiber) are scared to death of it.

Just like the transition away from physical media to digital within the music industry, the industry <em>will</em> go this way.Â  As iTunes did for digital music, someone else will do for programmatic TV buying.Â  And the agencies who are already masters will have a big advantage.
