In a <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Location-based-services.aspx" target="_blank">study released by the Pew Research Institute</a> earlier today, it was discovered that ...
<h2><em>74% of smartphone owners use their phone to get real-time location-based information</em></h2>
Other highlights featured in the study include:
<ul>
	<li>Nearly 1 in 5 (18%) of all smartphone owners use geo-social apps to 'check in'</li>
	<li>65% of smartphone owners have used their phone to get turn-by-turn directions</li>
	<li>As of May 2012, 10% of all smartphone owners use geosocial services like Four Square</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>How often do you use geosocial services? Do you communicate with your consumers in these applications?</em></h2>
