<h3><em>What's the difference between a user and a customer?</em></h3>
Yesterday, I had the pleasure of listening to a <a href="http://www.digiday.com/agency/can-agencies-attract-top-tech-talent/ " target="_blank">DigiDay interview with Aaron Shapiro</a>, the CEO of digital agency Huge in New York city, when Aaron brought up the concept of a user versus a customer.

Specifically, Aaron was discussing how the digital customer should really be defined as the digital user; that is, everyone must have a digital strategy of how they are going to interact and speak to their users online because they are many more users (think Facebook, Twitter, etc) than there are customers.
<h3></h3>
<h3><em>Business is being defined by the internet.</em></h3>
There is no such thing as an 'offline business' anymore. Here's why:
<ol>
	<li>In 2012, 50% of transactions will be a result of digital. This means that the product was either Â bought online or the user researched the product online and then went into their local bricks-and-mortar retailer and purchased there.</li>
	<li>89% of users research a purchase online before pulling the trigger -- regardless of whether they purchase in store or over the web</li>
</ol>
According to Aaron, this means brands need to establish a digital relationship with this individuals. They need to classify them as users of their product, not simply customers.
<h3><em>As a brand, what are you doing to establish a relationship with your users?Â </em></h3>
<h3><em>As an agency, what are you doing to establish a relationship with your users?</em></h3>
