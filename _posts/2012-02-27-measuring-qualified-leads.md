<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-698" title="quality leads" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Quality-MLM-Lead1.jpeg" alt="sales leads" width="290" height="234" />At some point in your working life, it's inevitable that this subject will be brought up by the client ...
<h2><em>Our conversions are booming, but how do we understand if these are quality leads?</em></h2>
Here are three different ways to measure or justify the quality of leads that your online marketing programs are driving:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trial to Paid: </strong>How many of the users that converted on a free, time-based trial of your product are actually moving from the free to paid version?</li>
<ul>
	<li>If you're seeing significant drop off from free to paid, then it's likely that you're driving unqualified leads who just wanted to download your white paper, not actually become a loyal user of your product</li>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Life Time Value: </strong>Once a lead is brought into your system, how much are they worth toward your company's bottom line?</li>
<ul>
	<li>Life time value is a great metric to measure against financial services or other long sales cycle type industries (insurance is another good category to use LTV for)</li>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Per Order Value: </strong>Every time a user hits the 'Buy Now' button on your website, how much money are they forking over?</li>
<ul>
	<li>Hotels, resorts &amp; casinos are smart to use this metric. For example, a hotel room on the Las Vegas strip is <em>always </em>more expensive on a Friday / Saturday night compared to a Tuesday.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2><em>What verticals have you worked in? How did you measure the quality of your incoming leads?</em></h2>
