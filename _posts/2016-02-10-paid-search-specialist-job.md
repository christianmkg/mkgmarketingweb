<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid Search Specialist // What's the Vision For This Role?</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This position is a 90 day contract position. But, our goal is to evaluate working together for 90 days, and if it’s a good fit, extend an offer for Full Time Employment (FTE).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our vision for this position is:</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% Paid Search across Google AdWords &amp; Bing Ads</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% Paid Social on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for outside-of-the-box thinkers; individuals who aren’t afraid to think of new ways to try things and test. Ideally: you have your testing hat on 24/7 and are continuously thinking about how you can try new ad copy / imagery / targeting / etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know that failure is inevitable. But failing is learning. And you can react quickly to try something new if you see something not gaining traction like you thought it would.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be working with client accounts that allow the flexibility to test and try new things.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our opinion, the opportunity upside is huge for this position. We want to hire a motivated individual who can grow into this job alongside our SEM Manager, Jessica Ward.</span>
