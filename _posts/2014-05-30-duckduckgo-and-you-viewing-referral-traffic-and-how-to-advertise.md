<p><a href="http://www.duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> is booming to the tune of 1 billion searches in 2013. Are you curious how much traffic is coming to your website from the privacy-focused search engine? Or how you can advertise on it?</p>

<p>Read on for your DuckDuckGo primer to learn all you need to know.</p>

<p>Duck...duck...GO!</p>

<h3>What Makes DuckDuckGo Unique?</h3>

<p>First and foremost, DuckDuckGo was built to be a search engine that focuses on privacy. They claim to not track searches or mine data for advertising or other purposes.</p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/about" target="_blank">How DuckDuckGo describes their search engine in a nicely bulleted list</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Real Privacy. <i>We don't track you.</i></li>
<li>Smarter Search. <i>Get answers quicker.</i></li>
<li>Less Clutter. <i>Fewer ads and reduced spam.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>While #1 and #3 are pretty easy to see (hover over a link in a SERP and copy the link address in DuckDuckGo and compare to Google to see), smarter search is debatable. There's probably a bit of a learning curve to have DuckDuckGo deliver the info you need right off the bat every time.</p>

<p>The popularity of DuckDuckGo has exploded after the NSA and PRISM revelations. In a pretty snazzy move, they are <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html" target="_blank">completely transparent about the traffic they receive</a>. Notice the latest milestone? DuckDuckGo has made the transition from ugly duckling to <i>sexy duckling</i> in their latest redesign.</p>

<p><i>Note: feel free to never search "sexy duck" in Google.</i></p>

<p>Moving on!</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo has made some updates to their site to include the introduction of features like image search, meanings of phrases (think Google's "answer boxes") and RECIPES (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tiramisu" target="_blank">search tiramisu</a> and I dare you to not immediately start salivating).  Wrap it all together in a much more refined interface and DuckDuckGo is starting to look the part of a proper search engine.</p>

<h3>Alright, So How Do You Check Your Website's Visits From DuckDuckGo?</h3>

<p><img src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/duckduckanalytics.png" alt="Analytics" width="1249" height="561" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4680" /></p>

<p>Log in to your Google Analytics account and click on your website's profile. From here, click on "Acquisition" then the "All Referrals" drop-down and search for "DuckDuckGo" to the right.</p>

<p><i>Note: next.duckduckgo.com was a preview of their new interface pre-launch and the r.duckduckgo.com is a redirect URL.</i></p>

<h3>How Do You Advertise on DuckDuckGo?</h3>

<p><img src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/addistribution.png" alt="Duck Duck Ads" width="685" height="157" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4681" /></p>

<p>They syndicate through Yahoo! via the Yahoo-Microsoft search alliance. This means that in order to advertise on DuckDuckGo, you would need to sign up for a Bing Ads account and make sure you have the "All search networks" or "Bing and Yahoo! syndicated search partners only" radial buttons selected under "Ad Distribution."</p>

<p><i>Note: You cannot just advertise on DuckDuckGo by itself. You can either advertise on Bing, Yahoo! and all their syndicated search partners, or just Bing/Yahoo!'s syndicated search partners. The dream of a "Duck, Duck, Go"-specific pun for your businesses' ad is no more.</i></p>

<h3>What's Next for DuckDuckGo?</h3>

<p>Traffic is growing, their interface is looking better than ever and DuckDuckGo has capitalized on a captivating theme in this modern day and age: privacy.  Their future is bright.</p>

<p>I hope this primer has answered any questions you may have about DuckDuckGo. I would encourage you to check them out (via their <a href="https://duck.co/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>, on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/duckduckgo" target="_blank">Reddit</a> or start <a href="http://www.duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">performing searches on their platform</a>) and keep an eye on this growing Google alternative.</p>
