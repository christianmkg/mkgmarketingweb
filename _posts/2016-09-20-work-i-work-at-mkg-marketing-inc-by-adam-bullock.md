The reason I work at MKG Marketing Inc.?

Easy:

<i>It's because the people I work with give a damn.</i>

We have all worked places where people just do...stuff.

And I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

You're expected to upsell 10% of current business, so everybody upsells 10% of their current business. Or a new advertising channel should be tested every quarter, so a new advertising channel is tested and just as quickly forgotten about.

People just kind of float by.

<strong>Well, things operate a little bit different around here.</strong>
<h2>Exceeding Expectations</h2>
Of all of <a href="http://mkgmarketinginc.com/about/values/" target="_blank">our values</a>, this is the one I am most proud of and why I work at MKG. We don't follow the status quo. Nor do we complete just do the bare minimum and call it good:
<blockquote>We go above and beyond expectations placed upon us by clients and colleagues.</blockquote>
That sense of pride in what we do is the biggest reason I look forward to every morning stand-up.
