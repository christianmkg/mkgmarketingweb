<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision &amp; Opportunity</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This position is a 90 day contract position. But, our goal is to evaluate working together for 90 days, and if it’s a good fit, extend an offer for Full Time Employment (FTE).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our vision for this position is:</span>

<b>50% Technical, On-Page SEO: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive of audits, technical optimizations, etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is pulling up your sleeves and getting your hands dirty work. Meaning: crawling sites, looking at exports, manually going through site to look for SEO opportunities, and helping to create a story that will be client-facing to present.</span>

<b><b>25% SEO Strategy: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Includes high level SEO strategy for our clients to execute on.</span></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes ensuring you’re up to snuff when it comes to new algorithm changes that Google makes, reading the latest SEO news, and looking at organic search traffic for our client sites and thinking, “What can we capitalize to further help traffic grow?”</span>

<b><b>25% Client Facing Support: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Includes meetings, ad-hoc requests and division of work between SEO Manager (you!) and the <a href="/about/team/christianbullock/" target="_blank">Search Marketing Director, Christian Bullock</a>.</span></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to know that you can walk the walk and talk the talk. Often with clients, we have weekly or bi-weekly meetings that have lots of questions about what’s going on with SEO. Having another voice in the room that’s knowledgeable and able to explain a complex thing in simple terms is helpful.</span>
<h3>Who You Are</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking for outside-of-the-box thinkers; individuals who have a really comprehensive base of knowledge (5+ years doing SEO) </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">still aren’t afraid to think of new ways to try things and test.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t just do SEO “by the book.” You tinker, you test, and you learn - whether it’s a positive or negative impact - and react quickly.You’ll be working with client accounts that allow the flexibility to test and try new things.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity upside is huge for this position. We are a growing company that has retained 90% of the clients brought on since we opened our doors in July 2011. Help establish our SEO team with Christian Bullock and know that your practices and techniques can help shape a potential entire department of folks.</span>
<h3>Day to Day: SEO</h3>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical SEO: ensure client sites are crawlable and have “user-based” SEO signals turned up to 11. Review site hierarchy and ensure any new pages a client has recently set live are placed appropriately. Review GSC / BWT profiles and ask the question, “Are these issues being reported big problems? Small problems? Or no problem?”</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site Audits: our team loves performing site audits. Why? We find that by doing so on a quarterly basis, we absolutely always find items our last audit didn’t uncover. You will help by pulling crawls together, ensuring we hit on every aspect of a website, and helping stack-rank a list of items that need to be addressed.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadmapping: often people call this a “content calendar” or an “editorial calendar” - we like roadmap. It tells the client, “Here are keyword opportunities and themes that our research has uncovered; let’s craft interesting Evergreen or temporal content for it.” It’s action-oriented: here is our warpath, now let’s get our army in place. You will help uncover these opportunities and scrape existing, related items to find what type of content has a high probability of being successful (the Skyscraper method).</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Client Support: clients have questions and we have answers. Support the Search Marketing Director by responding to requests and ensure any new items get slotted into our workflow.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO Strategy: “be off the grid” and do high level thinking about the state of our client’s websites and their organic search traffic. What are some things we can do - traditional and nontraditional - that can help bump up traffic?</span></li>
