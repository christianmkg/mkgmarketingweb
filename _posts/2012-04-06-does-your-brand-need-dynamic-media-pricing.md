But a bigger question still remains ...
<h2><strong><em>As a brand, how do you know if RTB is right for your marketing efforts?</em></strong></h2>
Here are a few sample questions to ask yourself:
<ul>
	<li>What is our desired 'end action' that we want users to take on our site? More importantly, do we have one?</li>
	<li>As long as ad verification tools like AdSafe or Double Verify are in place, are we okay giving up some control over how many impressions we get on specific sites?</li>
	<li>Are we equipped to analyze with the reams of extremely valuable data that RTB platforms will produce for us? Do we need to bring in help to analyze said data?</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>RTB platforms are changing the digital media landscape -- but are they right for your brand?</em></h2>
