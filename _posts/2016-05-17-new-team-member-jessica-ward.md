Well, you’re right! We've just been so busy, that I haven't been able to write this post until now. :)
<h2>Professional Background</h2>
I got the opportunity to work in digital marketing right out of college and haven’t looked back. I’ve worked in-house and at agencies. I’ve worked with companies that specialize in healthcare, SaaS products, consumer goods, and so many others that I’m having a hard time remembering them all at the time of this writing. I’m currently on the board for <a href="https://www.sempdx.org/" target="_blank">SEMpdx</a>, a professional organization based in Portland, Oregon dedicated to informing and educating the community about Digital Marketing.

At MKG, I am the SEM Manager and Digital Strategist. Which means that I guide the strategy for our Paid Media accounts (paid search, display advertising, and social advertising) and also help with the every day management of these accounts.
<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, partaking in the many activities that Pacific Northwest affords its residents, reading a great book, and dancing around the house with my son. I also enjoy volunteering for <a href="http://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/" target="_blank">Shriner's Hospital for Children in Portland</a>, which is an amazing organization. If you don't know about the services they provide, make sure to check out their website.
