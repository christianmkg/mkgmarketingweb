We received a great question from one of our clients recently. That question was:
<blockquote>What targeting options does Facebook Ads have?</blockquote>
After explaining the high-level options, the client replied with:
<blockquote>Yeah, but what are <strong>all</strong> of the targeting options? Does Facebook have this available anywhere?</blockquote>
Much to our surprise, we couldn't find a resource that really showed in a comprehensive yet succinct view the wealth of different targeting options that Facebook Ads had available for advertisers.

So we decided to record it.

Below is a video that goes over each targeting option that Facebook has available in April 2015. We didn't click into each specific category (that would take far too long) but did want to highlight all of the different targeting options along with some use-cases on how powerful targeting can be with FB Ads.
