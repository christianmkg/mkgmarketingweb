<h3>Can You Guess Who the Fastest Growing Companies Are in the US?</h3>
<p>Each year, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fastest-growing/" target="_blank">CNN Money releases their 100 Fastest Growing Companies list </a>that highlights the fastest growing companies in the United States. The criteria include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Revenue ($)</li>
	<li>Revenue Growth (3 year)</li>
	<li>Profit Growth (3 year)</li>
	<li>Total Return (3 year)</li>
	<li>Net Income ($ millions)</li>
</ul>

<p>The companies tend to change each and every year, but one thing stays the same:</p>

<h3>These Companies Websites' All Could Use a Lot of Work</h3>
<p>From the overall website design down to the user experience (UX), many companies on the rise simply don't have time to freshen up their website as they continue to grow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for these companies, a smooth functioning and well-designed website is an essential sales tool for an organization.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/enterprise/search/files/Google_MaximizingWebsiteROI.pdf" target="_blank">Google advocates a provenÂ methodical approach</a>Â to website design and UX that features four steps, one of which we have highlighted below:</p>

<blockquote>Optimize the site by determining which combinations of site content and design <strong>drive the most conversions</strong></blockquote>

<p>With that said, we randomly selected three companies from this years 100 Fastest Growing Companies List and noted:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One minor change they could make that would greatly improve their website design and UX</li>
	<li>One change they can make to their website's SEO to improve their search ranking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>United Therapeutics</h3>

<p>United Therapeutics creates products that address the unmet needs of medical patients.</p>

<p>With 33% revenue growth over the past three years, United Therapeutics is positioning themselves to continue delivering valuable medical technologies to the world for years to come.</p>

<p>So what's wrong with their website?</p>

<h4>No Clear Call to Action</h4>
<img alt="United Therapeutics homepage" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/United-Therapeutics.png" />

<p>Take a look at the screenshot above: As you reach their homepage, what action do you think they want you to take next? Read about the company history? Contact the company directly?</p>

<p>A well designed website will usually highlight specific actions site visitors should take based upon images, buttons, color schemes &amp; other design elements.</p>

<h4>On the note of a lacking call to action, a few organic search improvements we noticed were:</h4>
<ol>
	<li><em><strong>Create separate product pages for the three products currently in market.</strong></em> Right now, they display all three of their products' information on the same page. If they could create a separate page for each and optimize these by name of product, they would have a better chance at having a higher ranking organic search position.</li>
	<li><em><strong>Currently, they have entirely independent domains for each product.</strong></em>Â Best case scenario would be to have those rank first or second along with a separate page on the Unither.com domain with additional information. Right now they're being beat out by websites like RXList.com, Mayoclinic.com, and medicinenet.com in organic search rankings</li>
</ol>

<h3>Questcor Pharmaceuticals</h3>
<p>Questcor isÂ a biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of patients with serious, difficult-to-treat autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.</p>

<p>With a 85% revenue increase over the past three years, Questcor saw their initial growth in the early 2000's from the purchase of anÂ anti-inflammatory drug called Acthar Gel. Made from the pituitary glands of pigs and approved by the FDA in 1952 and bought for the bargain price of $100,000, Questcor improved the product and increased the cost per unit by 16x in a few short years, leading to a massive spike in stock price and enabling R&amp;D into other medical products.</p>

<p>So what's wrong with their website?</p>
<h4>Cluttered Pages with High Text Density</h4>
<img alt="Questcor Biopharmaceutical company" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Questcor-Biopharmaceutical-company.png"/>

<p>As our friend <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/11-common-mistakes-blunders-in-web-design/" target="_blank">Hong Kiat wrote in 11 Common Mistakes in Web Design</a>, cluttered webpages that have a high text density are tough to consume for the visitor and lead to website bounces.</p>

<h4>On the note of a lacking call to action, a few organic search improvements we noticed were:</h4>
<p><strong>Unique Meta Descriptions by Page:</strong>Without a meta description tag, you rely on search engines, like Google and Bing, to predict what the most relevant snippet for your result should be.</p>

<p>By laying in meta description tags, you're able to control what the snippet will display, Â allowing you to really hit on any messaging that you feel would sway a user into clicking on your result.</p>

<p>Meta descriptions do not influence ranking, but what they do affect click-through-rate on the search engine result page (SERP).</p>

<p>On a security note, we found a page on their website that displays names and email addresses for those taking charge of specific elements of their website. This page definitely should not be publicly viewable.</p>

<h3>Taro Pharmaceutical Industries</h3>

<p>Simply put: Taro Pharmaceutical Industries develops, markets and researches prescription medications to many countries across the globe.</p>

<p>So what's wrong with their website?</p>

<h4>No Clear Call to Action</h4>

<img alt="Taro Pharmaceuticals" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Taro-Pharmaceuticals.png" />

<p>Again, <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/11-common-mistakes-blunders-in-web-design/" target="_blank">Hong Kiat's article</a>Â points out the dangers of having no real call to action on your website.</p>

<h4>On the note of a lacking call to action, a few organic search improvements we noticed were:</h4>

<p>Taro also lacks title tags for MANY of their pages.</p>

<p>Having unique, optimized title tags helps improve on-page SEO as well as helping those pages show something that you can control on the search engine result page (a page's title tag is the clickable part of a web page's result).</p>

<h3>Contrary to What You Think: We're not trying to be jerks!</h3>

<p>We simply noticed that a few of the fastest growing companies have websites that don't accurately reflect the budding brand they are building.</p>

<p>There are many great web design resources out there. If you have a minute, please post some of your favorites in the comments section below!</p>
