<h1>Introducing Dirk Strauss</h1>
We'd like to introduce you to our friend <a href="http://dirkstrauss.com/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://dirkstrauss.com">Dirk Strauss</a>.

Dirk is a software developer and Microsoft MVP who lives and works in South Africa. He writes a lot of technical and how-to guides for .NET and C# developers.

Oh yeah - he has a SWEET accent as well :D
<h2>Why are we talking about Dirk?</h2>
Last month we worked with <a href="http://www.dirkstrauss.com/video/parallels-desktop-run-visual-studio-on-your-mac" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.dirkstrauss.com/video/parallels-desktop-run-visual-studio-on-your-mac">Dirk on a Parallels Desktop influencer program</a>. After he finished his video demo and write up, we asked him one simple question:

<i>How do you promote the content that you write?</i>

And let me tell you: It was neat hearing from a technical writer!

So neat, in fact, that we recorded a podcast of our conversation. You can listen to that at the top <em>or </em>bottom of this post.
<h2><i></i>How Dirk<em> </em>Promotes His Writing</h2>
Dirk mentioned that four most common ways he gets readers to the blog:
<ul>
	<li>Paid Facebook Advertising</li>
	<li>Paid StumbleUpon</li>
	<li>Blog Commenting</li>
	<li>Search Engine traffic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dirk's Number #1 Source of Traffic: SEO</h2>
The absolute best source of traffic for Dirk's blog is: <strong>Organic Search Engines (SEO)</strong>.

Let's hear it direct from him:
<blockquote><em>Search engine visitors from Google and Bing are looking for advice. "How to fix this..." or "Why is that broken?"</em>

<em>The reason I enjoy blogging is because I get to share my expertise with others and help them. I research coding practices the exact same way my readers do. We attack search engines and forums looking for answers.</em>

<em>And if there are none? Then I write up a post.</em>

<em>Stories that get the most traffic SOLVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. This is the type of information I like to write about and read. It helps people. And that's all that matters.</em></blockquote>
<h2>Dirk's 3 Tips for Technical Writing</h2>
At the conclusion of our podcast, Dirk summed up his insights into three helpful tips.
<ol>
	<li>Content is not Static: Think how your readers consume your content. Video? Audio? Blog posts? Think about the right mix.</li>
	<li>Fresh Content: Don't get in the habit of writing every day for a month and then falling off the face of the earth. Get in the habit of writing on a schedule.</li>
	<li>How Wide is Your Niche? Think about how narrow or wide your writing topics are. Will you write stories for a small niche? Well, then expect that you'll have a glass ceiling on traffic figures. Writing for both niche <em>and </em>general technical readers gets you more readers.</li>
</ol>
