<h2><em><img class="alignleft  wp-image-719" title="think outside the box phrase on blackboard" src="http://mkgmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Black-Board-223x300.jpg" alt="big data data management DMP platform" width="178" height="240" />A DMP -- or Data Management Platform -- is a centralized location that use first and third party data sources to create custom data segments.</em></h2>
These segments are valuable because:
<ul>
	<li>They allow brands to target campaigns more accurately</li>
	<li>Brands can measure which audience segments performed the best</li>
	<li>Â Brands can refine media buyingÂ efficienciesÂ as they collect actionable results over time</li>
</ul>
<em>And these are just a few of the valuable examples ---- Woot!</em>
<h2><em>As an advertiser, how do you know if you need a DMP or not?</em></h2>
Well, here are a couple questions to get the conversation started:
<ul>
	<li>Does your brand manage campaigns across multiple ad networks, data partners &amp; inventory exchange sources?</li>
	<li>Do you want a tighter leash on your advertising costs and hone in on ROI as your key performance metric?</li>
	<li>Does your brand retarget users and you'd like to scale this tactic up or target more specific niches?</li>
	<li>Does your company buy media placements, third party data or utilize inventory exchange sources on a regular basis?</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Tomorrow, we'll examine five valuable things that your brand should expect to receive when onboarding a DMP platform.</em></h2>
