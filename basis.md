            <p>Needed to attract new parent leads at a more efficient cost per acquisition (CPA) than current clip.</p>

          <p>Experts are quantified by having 8+ years of experience in a specific service. Collectively MKG has 50+ years of experience. Your account will never be handled by anyone below a senior role. It’s not fair to the assistants in the industry who are handed more responsibility then they’re ready for or fair to you, the client.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> BASIS had been working with a media partner that a) buried their service fees into the media spend, and b) was not efficient enough attracting new parent leads for the BASIS Independent family of schools (5 campuses in total). BASIS expressed a real need for a media partner that was more strategic in their approach while also keeping an eye out for brand new opportunities the BASIS brand could be taking advantage of across Facebook and Google AdWords.</p>

          <h2>How We Got There</h2>
          <p>Testing, trying new ad formats, and T-E-S-T-I-N-G.</p>
          <p>We started with a broad audience and had A/B testing running on nearly every available part of an ad that we could. In addition, we looked at which ad types resonated with which audience, and refined our advertising from there. At the end, we put the best message with the best creative in front of the appropriate audience.</p>
          <p>Add in a dash of experienced marketing wizardry and some optimization voodoo, of course.</p>
