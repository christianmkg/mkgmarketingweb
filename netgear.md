<h2>Background</h2>
<p>NETGEAR invested in a centralized web marketing team to assist product and demand gen marketing teams at NETGEAR HQ. They were unsure how to best assist product and demand generation marketing colleagues with Organic Search needs and required an experienced SEO agency to come in and help lay the foundation for this relationship to help NETGEAR as a whole grow.</p>
